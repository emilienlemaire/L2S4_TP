{153}{245}Okay, hold on,|don't shoot.
{245}{296}- You see where you're going?|- Mm-hmm.
{296}{318}Okay.
{318}{369}Now, let's worry|about how you get there.
{386}{433}Gotta move|your foot here.
{433}{476}Point your toe this way.
{476}{519}Your hips here.
{519}{554}Okay?
{569}{604}- Can you see?|- Yeah.
{604}{631}- Are you sure?|- Mm-hmm.
{631}{668}How about now?|Can you see now?
{668}{705}- No.|- How about now?
{754}{780}All right.
{793}{844}Ready? Three fingers.
{858}{889}Nice!
{925}{963}Nice throw, kiddo.
{963}{996}Here you go.
{996}{1053}Hey, you guys|want mayo? Or mustard?
{1053}{1096}Or both?
{1096}{1146}Who puts mayo|on a hot dog?
{1146}{1173}Probably your brothers.
{1173}{1224}Uh, two mustard, please!|Thanks, Mama.
{1224}{1261}Got it!
{1261}{1301}Nate, mayo or mustard?
{1314}{1350}How about ketchup?
{1350}{1408}Or ketchup.|I got ketchup, too.
{1408}{1433}Mind your elbow.
{1483}{1533}Good job, hawk-eye.
{1533}{1600}Go get your arrow.
{1650}{1677}Hey, guys!
{1677}{1737}Enough practice.|Soup's on!
{1737}{1760}All right.
{1761}{1800}We're coming.|We're hungry.
{1821}{1860}Lila, let's go.
{1933}{1961}Lila?
{2032}{2056}Honey?
{2149}{2175}Hey, babe?
{2384}{2437}Babe?
{2485}{2520}Babe?
{2538}{2584}Boys!
{2627}{2651}Boys!
{2705}{2735}Laura!
{3787}{3822}You don't need|to do that.
{3822}{3893}Because, uh, you're just|holding the position.
{3912}{3950}Oh, yeah.
{3950}{4015}That was close.
{4015}{4061}That's a goal.|We are now one apiece.
{4061}{4097}I would like to try again.
{4154}{4215}We're tied up.|Feel the tension?
{4215}{4252}It's fun.
{4253}{4305}That was terrible.|Now you have a chance to win.
{4334}{4358}And you've won.
{4384}{4414}Congratulations.
{4414}{4445}Fair game.
{4477}{4512}Good sport.
{4531}{4567}You have fun?
{4607}{4658}It was fun.
{5197}{5237}This thing on?
{5283}{5336}Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.
{5361}{5431}If you find this recording...
{5431}{5500}don't post it on social media.
{5500}{5555}It's gonna be|a real tearjerker.
{5555}{5619}I don't know if you're|ever gonna see these.
{5619}{5683}I don't even know|if you're still...
{5683}{5728}Oh, God, I hope so.
{5749}{5805}<i>Today's day 21.</i>
{5805}{5871}<i>No, uh, 22.</i>
{5871}{5937}<i>You know, if it wasn't for|the existential terror...</i>
{5937}{5990}<i>of staring into|the literal void of space,</i>
{5990}{6051}<i>I'd say I'm feeling|a little better today.</i>
{6051}{6084}<i>Infection's run its course,</i>
{6084}{6139}<i>thanks to|the Blue Meanie back there.</i>
{6139}{6182}<i>Oh, you'd love her.</i>
{6182}{6223}<i>Very practical.</i>
{6223}{6277}<i>Only a tiny bit sadistic.</i>
{6392}{6445}<i>So, the fuel cells were|cracked during battle...</i>
{6445}{6500}<i>and we figured out a way|to reverse the ion charge...</i>
{6500}{6576}<i>and bought ourselves about|48 hours of flight time.</i>
{6650}{6696}<i>Uh, but it's now dead|in the water.</i>
{6696}{6783}<i>Thousand light years|from the nearest 7-Eleven.</i>
{6816}{6876}<i>Oxygen will run out|tomorrow morning...</i>
{6910}{6952}<i>and that'll be it.</i>
{7029}{7106}<i>Pep, I know I said|no more surprises...</i>
{7106}{7150}<i>but I gotta say|I was really hoping</i>
{7150}{7197}<i>to pull off one last one.</i>
{7197}{7248}<i>But it looks like...</i>
{7248}{7296}<i>Well, you know|what it looks like.</i>
{7324}{7372}Don't feel bad about this.
{7372}{7459}I mean, actually, if you|grovel for a couple weeks...
{7459}{7538}and then move on|with enormous guilt...
{7656}{7705}I should probably lie down|for a minute.
{7705}{7757}Go rest my eyes.
{7824}{7887}Please know...
{7887}{7984}when I drift off, it'll be|like every night lately.
{7984}{8055}I'm fine. Totally fine.
{8068}{8102}I dream about you.
{8137}{8177}Because it's always you.
{13036}{13067}Couldn't stop him.
{13068}{13095}Neither could I.
{13095}{13127}Hang on.
{13178}{13223}I lost the kid.
{13281}{13321}Tony, we lost.
{13375}{13399}Is, uh...?
{13418}{13464}- Oh, good.|- Oh, my God!
{13483}{13524}Oh, my God!
{13640}{13683}It's okay.
{13829}{13888}It's been 23 days|since Thanos came to Earth.
{13946}{14010}World governments|are in pieces.
{14010}{14057}The parts that are|still working...
{14057}{14148}...are trying to take a census|and it looks like he did...
{14210}{14253}He did exactly what he said|he was gonna do.
{14253}{14284}Thanos wiped out...
{14336}{14415}...50% of all|living creatures.
{14517}{14567}Where is he now? Where?
{14567}{14607}We don't know.
{14608}{14691}He just opened a portal|and walked through.
{14751}{14776}What's wrong with him?
{14801}{14851}Oh, he's pissed.
{14852}{14887}He thinks he failed.
{14920}{14947}Which, of course, he did...
{14947}{15000}but there's a lot of that|going around, ain't there?
{15000}{15034}Honestly,|until this exact second
{15034}{15068}I thought you were|a Build-A-Bear.
{15068}{15102}Maybe I am.
{15102}{15141}We've been hunting Thanos|for three weeks now.
{15141}{15194}Deep space scans...
{15194}{15246}and satellites,|and we got nothing.
{15285}{15311}Tony, you fought him.
{15311}{15339}Who told you that?
{15352}{15380}I didn't fight him.
{15380}{15419}No, he wiped my face|with a planet...
{15419}{15452}while the Bleecker Street|magician
{15452}{15483}gave away the store.
{15483}{15512}That's what happened.
{15512}{15544}There was no fight,|'cause he's not beatable.
{15544}{15613}Did he give you any clues,|any coordinates, anything?
{15613}{15650}Uh...
{15679}{15720}I saw this coming|a few years back.
{15720}{15771}I had a vision.|I didn't wanna believe it.
{15771}{15811}Thought I was dreaming.
{15812}{15839}Tony, I'm gonna|need you to focus.
{15839}{15885}And I needed you.
{15885}{15914}As in, past tense.
{15914}{15998}That trumps what you need.|It's too late, buddy.
{15998}{16038}Sorry.
{16038}{16127}You know what I need?|I need a shave.
{16127}{16189}And I believe I remember|telling all youse...
{16189}{16212}Tony, Tony!
{16212}{16298}...alive and otherwise,|that what we needed
{16298}{16345}was a suit of armor|around the world.
{16345}{16375}Remember that?
{16375}{16438}Whether it impacted|our precious freedoms or not.
{16438}{16470}That's what we needed.
{16470}{16503}Well, that didn't|work out, did it?
{16503}{16538}I said we'd lose.
{16538}{16604}You said, "We'll do that|together, too."
{16604}{16638}And guess what, Cap?
{16638}{16676}We lost.
{16676}{16705}And you weren't there.
{16735}{16767}But that's what|we do, right?
{16767}{16836}Our best work after the fact?|We're the "Avengers."
{16836}{16891}We're the "Avengers,"|not the "Pre-vengers."
{16891}{16919}- Okay.|- Right?
{16919}{16949}You made your point.|Just sit down, okay?
{16949}{16980}Okay. No, no, here's my point.|You know what?
{16980}{17015}- She's great by the way.|- Tony, you're sick. Sit down.
{17015}{17055}We need you.|You're new blood.
{17055}{17131}Bunch of tired old mules.|I got nothing for you, Cap.
{17131}{17164}I got no coordinates...
{17164}{17235}no clues, no strategies,|no options.
{17235}{17280}Zero. Zip. Nada.
{17280}{17328}No trust, liar.
{17435}{17467}Here, take this.
{17467}{17522}You find him,|you put that on...
{17531}{17570}you hide.
{17595}{17645}- Tony!|- I'm fine.
{17645}{17687}Let me...
{17836}{17870}Bruce gave him|a sedative.
{17870}{17916}He's gonna probably be out|for the rest of the day.
{17937}{17978}You guys|take care of him...
{17978}{18017}and I'll bring him a Xorrian|elixir when I come back.
{18033}{18060}Where are you going?
{18060}{18102}To kill Thanos.
{18170}{18199}Hey.
{18199}{18253}You know, we usually work|as a team here...
{18253}{18298}and, uh, between you and I,|morale's a little fragile.
{18298}{18360}We realize up there|is more your territory,
{18360}{18389}but this is|our fight, too.
{18389}{18424}You even know|where he is?
{18424}{18455}I know people who might.
{18455}{18490}Don't bother.
{18508}{18556}I can tell you|where Thanos is.
{18610}{18698}Thanos spent a long time|trying to perfect me.
{18698}{18798}And when he worked,|he talked about his Great Plan.
{18798}{18879}Even disassembled,|I wanted to please him.
{18879}{18922}I'd ask...
{18922}{19002}where would we go|once his plan was complete?
{19002}{19055}And his answer|was always the same.
{19150}{19187}"To the Garden."
{19187}{19261}That's cute.|Thanos has a retirement plan.
{19261}{19301}So, where is he?
{19301}{19355}When Thanos snapped|his fingers...
{19355}{19409}Earth became ground zero|for a power surge
{19409}{19456}of ridiculously|cosmic proportions.
{19456}{19511}No one's ever seen|anything like it.
{19511}{19547}Until two days ago...
{19591}{19631}on this planet.
{19645}{19683}Thanos is there.
{19721}{19768}He used the stones again.
{19768}{19808}Hey, hey, hey.
{19808}{19859}We'd be going in|shorthanded, you know?
{19859}{19898}Look, he's still|got the stones, so...
{19898}{19940}So, let's get 'em.
{19940}{19979}Use them to bring|everyone back.
{19979}{20008}Just like that?
{20008}{20047}Yeah. Just like that.
{20047}{20125}Even if there's a small chance|that we can undo this...
{20125}{20199}I mean, we owe it to everyone|who's not in this room to try.
{20199}{20237}If we do this,|how do we know
{20237}{20298}it's gonna end any differently|than it did before?
{20298}{20339}Because before|you didn't have me.
{20360}{20386}Hey, new girl?
{20386}{20472}Everybody in this room|is about that superhero life.
{20472}{20500}And if you don't mind|my asking,
{20500}{20531}where the hell|have you been all this time?
{20531}{20583}There are a lot of other|planets in the universe.
{20583}{20657}And unfortunately,|they didn't have you guys.
{21130}{21179}I like this one.
{21286}{21347}Let's go get|this son of a bitch.
{21871}{21903}Okay.
{21903}{21963}Who here hasn't been|to space?
{21989}{22019}Why?
{22019}{22068}You better not throw up|on my ship.
{22068}{22103}Approaching jump in three...
{22111}{22155}two, one.
{22473}{22520}<i>I'll head down for recon.</i>
{22962}{23002}This is gonna work, Steve.
{23002}{23042}I know it will.
{23125}{23195}'Cause I don't know what|I'm gonna do if it doesn't.
{23195}{23284}<i>No satellites.|No ships. No armies.</i>
{23284}{23327}<i>No ground defenses|of any kind.</i>
{23372}{23414}<i>It's just him.</i>
{23426}{23474}And that's enough.
{25604}{25637}Oh, no.
{25870}{25905}Where are they?
{25905}{25953}Answer the question.
{26010}{26070}The universe|required correction.
{26070}{26169}After that, the stones|served no purpose...
{26169}{26208}beyond temptation.
{26208}{26278}You murdered trillions!
{26278}{26337}You should be grateful.
{26419}{26468}Where are the stones?
{26468}{26507}Gone.
{26507}{26546}Reduced to atoms.
{26546}{26587}You used them two days ago!
{26587}{26668}I used the stones|to destroy the stones.
{26683}{26723}It nearly killed me.
{26755}{26806}But the work is done.
{26806}{26872}It always will be.
{26912}{26991}I am inevitable.
{27040}{27103}We have to tear this place apart.|He has to be lying!
{27103}{27136}My father|is many things.
{27158}{27207}A liar is not one of them.
{27256}{27288}Ah.
{27303}{27338}Thank you, daughter.
{27403}{27454}Perhaps I treated you|too harshly.
{27608}{27632}What?
{27645}{27688}What did you do?
{27722}{27771}I went for the head.
{29467}{29523}<i>So...</i>
{29549}{29614}...I, uh, went on a date|the other day.
{29614}{29658}It's the first time|in five years.
{29658}{29718}You know? I'm sitting there|at dinner.
{29741}{29794}I didn't even know|what to talk about.
{29824}{29862}What did you talk about?
{29862}{29945}Eh, same old crap. You know,|how things have changed.
{29962}{30002}My job, his job.
{30022}{30072}How much we miss the Mets.
{30123}{30167}And then things got quiet...
{30214}{30304}then he cried as they were|serving the salads.
{30304}{30342}What about you?
{30363}{30445}I cried just before dessert.
{30531}{30586}But I'm seeing him|again tomorrow, so...
{30599}{30631}That's great.
{30631}{30674}You did the hardest part.|You took the jump.
{30674}{30742}You didn't know where|you were gonna come down.
{30742}{30789}And that's it.|That's those little
{30789}{30846}brave baby steps|we gotta take...
{30846}{30942}to try and become whole again,|try and find purpose.
{30982}{31018}I went in the ice in '45,
{31018}{31082}right after I met|the love of my life.
{31099}{31142}Woke up 70 years later.
{31217}{31270}You gotta move on.
{31332}{31373}Gotta move on.
{31485}{31549}The world is in our hands.
{31549}{31602}It's left to us, guys.
{31602}{31658}And we gotta do|something with it.
{31672}{31709}Otherwise...
{31734}{31793}Thanos should've killed|all of us.
{33278}{33314}What the hell?
{33606}{33638}Hope?
{34433}{34460}Kid!
{34460}{34490}Hey, kid!
{34587}{34644}What the hell happened here?
{35400}{35449}Oh, my God!
{35513}{35553}Oh, please!
{35554}{35591}Please, please!
{35591}{35644}No, no, no. No.
{35677}{35713}No.
{35762}{35794}Excuse me. Sorry.
{35794}{35827}Oh, Cassie, no.
{35827}{35865}No, no, no.
{35896}{35956}No, no.
{35956}{36031}Please, please, please.|No, Cassie.
{36203}{36230}What?
{36951}{36986}Cassie?
{37014}{37045}Dad?
{37664}{37729}You're so big!
{38042}{38074}<i>Yeah. We boarded</i>
{38074}{38156}<i>that highly-suspect|warship Danvers pinged.</i>
{38156}{38201}<i>It was an infectious|garbage scow.</i>
{38202}{38237}<i>So, thanks|for the hot tip.</i>
{38237}{38271}<i>Well, you were closer.</i>
{38271}{38309}<i>Yeah. And now|we smell like garbage.</i>
{38309}{38342}You get a reading|on those tremors?
{38342}{38409}<i>'Twas a mild subduction|under the African plate.</i>
{38409}{38466}Do we have a visual?|How are we handling it?
{38466}{38502}<i>Nat.</i>
{38502}{38553}<i>It's an earthquake|under the ocean.</i>
{38553}{38641}<i>We handle it|by not handling it.</i>
{38641}{38705}Carol, are we seeing you|here next month?
{38705}{38732}<i>Not likely.</i>
{38732}{38774}<i>What? You gonna get|another haircut?</i>
{38774}{38808}<i>Listen, fur face.</i>
{38808}{38855}<i>I'm covering|a lot of territory.</i>
{38855}{38901}<i>The things that are|happening on Earth</i>
{38901}{38941}<i>are happening|everywhere.</i>
{38941}{38984}<i>On thousands of planets.</i>
{38984}{39024}<i>All right, all right.|That's a good point.</i>
{39024}{39053}<i>That's a good point.</i>
{39053}{39107}<i>So, you might not see me|for a long time.</i>
{39123}{39169}All right. Uh, well...
{39186}{39240}This channel's|always active.
{39240}{39293}So, if anything|goes sideways...
{39293}{39357}anyone's making trouble|where they shouldn't...
{39357}{39385}comes through me.
{39385}{39428}<i>Okay.</i>
{39428}{39465}All right.
{39480}{39510}<i>Good luck.</i>
{39713}{39741}Where are you?
{39741}{39768}<i>Mexico.</i>
{39768}{39836}<i>The Federales found|a room full of bodies.</i>
{39836}{39875}<i>Looks like a bunch|of cartel guys...</i>
{39875}{39930}<i>never even had a chance|to get their guns off.</i>
{39930}{39976}It's probably a rival gang.
{39976}{40009}<i>Except it isn't.</i>
{40009}{40074}<i>It's definitely Barton.</i>
{40074}{40113}<i>What he's done here...</i>
{40113}{40209}<i>what he's been doing|for the last few years...</i>
{40209}{40257}<i>I mean, the scene|that he left...</i>
{40281}{40308}<i>I gotta tell you,</i>
{40308}{40369}<i>there's a part of me that|doesn't even wanna find him.</i>
{40496}{40553}Will you find out|where he's going next?
{40647}{40678}<i>Nat?</i>
{40717}{40760}Please?
{40798}{40830}<i>Okay.</i>
{41033}{41089}You know, I'd offer|to cook you dinner...
{41089}{41129}but you seem|pretty miserable already.
{41226}{41266}You here|to do your laundry?
{41266}{41306}And to see a friend.
{41327}{41393}Clearly, your friend is fine.
{41455}{41491}You know,|I saw a pod of whales
{41491}{41521}when I was coming over|the bridge.
{41521}{41569}- In the Hudson?|- There's fewer ships...
{41569}{41601}cleaner water.
{41601}{41653}You know, if you're|about to tell me
{41653}{41704}to look on the bright side...
{41704}{41737}Um...
{41755}{41788}I'm about to hit you|in the head
{41788}{41845}with a peanut butter sandwich.
{41845}{41869}Hmm.
{41890}{41921}Sorry.
{41921}{41953}Force of habit.
{42289}{42327}You know,|I keep telling everybody
{42327}{42374}they should move on...
{42374}{42413}and grow.
{42441}{42470}Some do.
{42551}{42589}But not us.
{42606}{42665}If I move on, who does this?
{42665}{42720}Maybe it doesn't need|to be done.
{42815}{42873}I used to have nothing.
{42900}{42946}And then I got this.
{42997}{43042}This job.
{43097}{43141}This family.
{43276}{43326}And I was better|because of it.
{43470}{43562}And even though|they're gone...
{43653}{43713}I'm still trying to be better.
{43781}{43847}I think we both|need to get a life.
{43905}{43935}You first.
{44061}{44099}<i>Oh, hi, hi!</i>
{44099}{44130}<i>Uh, is anyone home?</i>
{44130}{44171}<i>This is, uh, Scott Lang.</i>
{44171}{44248}<i>We met a few years ago|at the airport...</i>
{44248}{44288}<i>in Germany?</i>
{44288}{44345}<i>I was the guy that got|really big. I had a mask on.</i>
{44345}{44386}- <i>You wouldn't recognize me.</i>|- Is this an old message?
{44386}{44465}<i>Ant-Man?|I know you know that.</i>
{44465}{44494}It's the front gate.
{44494}{44531}<i>I really need|to talk to you guys.</i>
{44677}{44704}Scott.
{44727}{44754}Are you okay?
{44754}{44783}Yeah.
{44817}{44885}Have either of you guys|ever studied quantum physics?
{44885}{44929}Only to make|conversation.
{44949}{44997}All right, so...
{44997}{45064}five years ago,|right before...
{45080}{45109}Thanos...
{45109}{45161}I was in a place called|the quantum realm.
{45161}{45232}The quantum realm is like|its own microscopic universe.
{45232}{45285}To get in there,|you have to be incredibly small.
{45285}{45325}Hope. She's my, um...
{45374}{45417}She was my...
{45454}{45485}She was supposed|to pull me out.
{45485}{45529}And then Thanos happened...
{45529}{45579}and I got stuck in there.
{45579}{45629}I'm sorry, that must have|been a very long five years.
{45629}{45668}Yeah, but that's just it.
{45668}{45698}It wasn't.
{45698}{45729}For me, it was five hours.
{45729}{45766}See, the rules|of the quantum realm
{45766}{45793}aren't like|they are up here.
{45793}{45836}Everything is unpredictable.
{45836}{45872}Is that anybody's sandwich?
{45872}{45901}I'm starving.
{45907}{45937}Scott.
{45937}{45971}What are you|talking about?
{45995}{46024}So...
{46047}{46104}what I'm saying is...
{46104}{46168}time works differently|in the quantum realm.
{46168}{46210}The only problem is|right now
{46210}{46248}we don't have a way|to navigate it.
{46249}{46292}But what if we did?
{46292}{46321}I can't stop thinking|about it.
{46321}{46371}What if we could somehow|control the chaos...
{46371}{46405}and we could navigate it?
{46405}{46442}What if there was a way...
{46442}{46485}that we could enter|the quantum realm
{46485}{46513}at a certain point in time...
{46513}{46552}but then exit|the quantum realm
{46553}{46583}at another point in time?
{46583}{46632}Like...
{46633}{46685}- Like before Thanos.|- Wait.
{46685}{46728}Are you talking|about a time machine?
{46729}{46799}No. No, of course not.|No, not a time machine.
{46799}{46829}This is more like a...
{46879}{46922}Yeah. Like a time machine.
{46922}{46968}I know, it's crazy.|It's crazy.
{46968}{47024}But I can't stop|thinking about it.
{47025}{47053}There's gotta be...
{47068}{47105}some way...
{47105}{47152}- It's crazy.|- Scott.
{47153}{47185}I get emails from a raccoon...
{47185}{47252}so nothing sounds crazy|anymore.
{47253}{47307}So, who do we talk to|about this?
{47744}{47769}Chow time!
{47826}{47856}Maguna.
{47953}{47989}Morgan H. Stark,|you want some lunch?
{48013}{48039}<i>Define "lunch"</i>
{48039}{48073}- <i>or be disintegrated.</i>|- Okay.
{48099}{48140}You should not be|wearing that, okay?
{48140}{48177}That is part of a special|anniversary gift
{48177}{48203}I'm making for Mom.
{48289}{48352}There you go.|You thinking about lunch?
{48352}{48406}I can give you a handful of|crickets on a bed of lettuce.
{48406}{48452}- No.|- That's what you want.
{48452}{48505}How did you find this?
{48505}{48553}- Garage.|- Really?
{48553}{48606}- Were you looking for it?|- No.
{48623}{48672}- I found it, though.|- Hmm.
{48672}{48718}You like going in|the garage, huh?
{48718}{48761}So does Daddy.
{48761}{48840}It's fine, actually.|Mom never wears anything I buy her.
{48901}{48935}So, I'm gonna...
{49348}{49412}No. We know|what it sounds like.
{49412}{49439}Tony, after everything|you've seen,
{49439}{49470}is anything really|impossible?
{49470}{49520}Quantum fluctuation messes|with the Planck scale...
{49520}{49563}which then triggers|the Deutsch Proposition.
{49563}{49596}Can we agree on that?
{49596}{49624}Thank you.
{49624}{49681}In layman's terms,|it means you're not coming home.
{49681}{49713}- I did.|- No.
{49713}{49760}You accidentally survived.
{49760}{49815}It's a billion-to-one|cosmic fluke.
{49815}{49898}And now you wanna pull a...|What do you call it?
{49942}{49976}A time heist?
{49976}{50032}Yeah, a time heist.|Of course.
{50032}{50064}Why didn't we think|of this before?
{50064}{50127}Oh, because it's laughable.|Because it's a pipe dream.
{50127}{50180}The stones are in the past.
{50180}{50213}We could go back,|we could get them.
{50213}{50270}We can snap our own fingers.|We can bring everybody back.
{50270}{50324}Or screw it up worse than|he already has, right?
{50324}{50360}I don't believe we would.
{50360}{50444}Gotta say it. I sometimes|miss that giddy optimism.
{50444}{50490}However, high hopes|won't help...
{50490}{50539}if there's no logical,|tangible way
{50539}{50623}for me to safely execute|said time heist.
{50623}{50670}I believe|the most likely outcome
{50670}{50702}will be our|collective demise.
{50702}{50768}Not if we strictly follow|the rules of time travel.
{50768}{50835}All right? It means no|talking to our past selves...
{50835}{50877}no betting|on sporting events.
{50877}{50920}I'm gonna stop you|right there, Scott.
{50943}{50976}Are you seriously|telling me
{50976}{51023}that your plan|to save the universe...
{51023}{51064}is based on|<i>Back to the Future?</i>
{51091}{51137}- Is it?|- No.
{51137}{51164}Good. You had me|worried there.
{51164}{51192}'Cause that would be|horseshit.
{51192}{51253}That's not how|quantum physics works.
{51253}{51280}Tony.
{51328}{51378}We have to take a stand.
{51378}{51424}We did stand.|And yet, here we are.
{51478}{51522}I know you got|a lot on the line.
{51522}{51584}You got a wife, a daughter.
{51584}{51649}But I lost someone|very important to me.
{51649}{51688}A lotta people did.
{51688}{51768}And now, now we have a chance|to bring her back...
{51768}{51796}to bring everyone back,
{51796}{51836}and you're telling me|that you won't even...
{51836}{51880}That's right, Scott.|I won't even.
{51917}{51955}I can't.
{52000}{52065}Mommy told me|to come and save you.
{52065}{52136}Good job. I'm saved.
{52136}{52191}I wish you were coming here|to ask me something else.
{52191}{52215}Anything else.
{52215}{52264}I'm honestly happy|to see you guys, I just...
{52264}{52297}Oh, look, the table's|set for six.
{52297}{52339}Tony. I get it.
{52339}{52397}And I'm happy for you.|I really am.
{52412}{52464}But this is a second chance.
{52464}{52528}I got my second chance|right here, Cap.
{52528}{52568}Can't roll the dice on it.
{52612}{52664}If you don't talk shop,|you can stay for lunch.
{52740}{52786}Well, he's scared.
{52786}{52810}He's not wrong.
{52810}{52865}Yeah, but, I mean,|what are we gonna do?
{52865}{52900}We need him.|What, are we gonna stop?
{52917}{52970}No, I wanna do it right.
{53041}{53088}We're gonna need|a really big brain.
{53108}{53149}Bigger than his?
{53149}{53196}Come on, I feel like I'm|the only one eating here.
{53196}{53222}Try some of that.
{53222}{53256}Have some eggs.
{53256}{53288}I'm so confused.
{53288}{53332}These are confusing times.
{53332}{53382}Right, no, no.|That's not what I meant.
{53382}{53449}Nah, I get it.|I'm kidding!
{53460}{53508}I know, it's crazy.
{53508}{53539}I'm wearing shirts now.
{53539}{53616}Yeah. What? How? Why?
{53616}{53688}Five years ago,|we got our asses beat.
{53688}{53732}Except it was worse|for me...
{53732}{53763}'cause I lost twice.
{53763}{53812}First, Hulk lost,|then Banner lost...
{53828}{53860}and then, we all lost.
{53860}{53897}No one blamed you, Bruce.
{53897}{53933}I did.
{53972}{54002}For years, I've been|treating the Hulk
{54002}{54035}like he's some kind|of disease...
{54035}{54082}something to get rid of.
{54082}{54164}But then, I start looking|at him as the cure.
{54164}{54217}Eighteen months|in the gamma lab.
{54217}{54284}I put the brains|and the brawn together...
{54284}{54318}and now, look at me.
{54338}{54388}Best of both worlds.
{54388}{54426}- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?|- Yes.
{54426}{54469}Can we get a photo?
{54469}{54520}100%, little person.
{54520}{54583}Come on, step on up.|Do you mind?
{54583}{54632}- Oh, yeah, yeah.|- Thanks.
{54632}{54671}Say "green."
{54671}{54730}- Green.|- Green.
{54730}{54757}Did you get that?
{54757}{54801}That's a good one.
{54801}{54864}Did you want to grab one|with me? I'm Ant-Man.
{54944}{54992}They're Hulk fans.|They don't know Ant-Man.
{54992}{55021}- Nobody does.|- No, he wants you to take
{55021}{55069}- a picture with him.|- I don't want a picture.
{55069}{55092}Stranger danger.
{55092}{55132}Yeah, look, he's even|saying no, he doesn't.
{55132}{55163}I get it.|I don't want it, either.
{55163}{55191}But come on. The kid...
{55191}{55226}I don't want a picture|with them.
{55226}{55255}- He's gonna feel bad.|- Sorry.
{55255}{55284}They're happy to do it.|They said they'll do it.
{55284}{55324}- I don't want to do it.|- We can do it.
{55324}{55380}- No, you feel bad.|- Take the goddamn phone.
{55380}{55409}Okay.
{55409}{55443}Thank you, Mr. Hulk.
{55443}{55485}No, it was great,|kids. Thank you very much.
{55485}{55524}Hulk out!
{55524}{55549}Bruce.
{55557}{55588}Dab.
{55588}{55640}- Bruce.|- Listen to your mom.
{55640}{55668}She knows better.
{55668}{55712}About what we were saying.
{55712}{55740}Right.
{55783}{55853}The whole time travel|do-over?
{55878}{55983}Eh, guys, it's outside|of my area of expertise.
{55983}{56032}Well, you pulled this off.
{56032}{56128}I remember a time when that|seemed pretty impossible, too.
{56925}{56961}I've got a mild inspiration.
{56961}{56997}I'd like to see|if it checks out.
{56997}{57048}So, I'd like to run|one last sim
{57048}{57092}before we pack it in|for the night.
{57092}{57165}This time, in the shape|of a Mobius strip,
{57165}{57203}inverted, please.
{57203}{57228}<i>Processing.</i>
{57305}{57375}Right, give me the eigenvalue|of that particle...
{57375}{57421}factoring in spectral decomp.
{57421}{57493}- That'll take a second.|- <i>Just a moment.</i>
{57493}{57568}And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.|I'm just kinda...
{57602}{57641}<i>Model rendered.</i>
{57924}{57955}Shit!
{57955}{57988}Shit!
{58080}{58126}What are you|doing up, little miss?
{58126}{58172}- Shit.|- Nope. We don't say that.
{58172}{58203}Only Mommy says that word.
{58203}{58243}She coined it.|It belongs to her.
{58243}{58272}Why are you up?
{58272}{58308}'Cause I've got some|important shit going on here!
{58308}{58339}Why do you think?
{58339}{58375}No, I got something|on my mind.
{58375}{58413}I got something on my mind.
{58413}{58452}Was it juice pops?
{58487}{58520}Sure was.
{58552}{58598}That's extortion.|That's a word.
{58598}{58628}What kind you want?
{58628}{58655}Great minds think alike.
{58656}{58705}Juice pops exactly...
{58752}{58783}was on my mind.
{58815}{58846}You done? Yeah?
{58856}{58884}Now you are.
{58896}{58928}Here. Wipe.
{58989}{59058}Good. That face|goes there.
{59058}{59095}Tell me a story.
{59095}{59128}A story.
{59128}{59195}Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed.|The end.
{59196}{59230}That is a horrible story.
{59230}{59278}Come on, that's|your favorite story.
{59292}{59319}Love you tons.
{59367}{59411}I love you 3,000.
{59440}{59464}Wow.
{59639}{59713}3,000.|That's crazy.
{59736}{59785}Go to bed or I'll sell|all your toys.
{59808}{59847}Night night.
{59847}{59884}Not that it's a competition...
{59884}{59939}but she loves me 3,000.
{59939}{59963}Does she, now?
{59963}{60042}You were somewhere|in the low 6 to 900 range.
{60185}{60235}Whatcha reading?
{60236}{60276}Just a book on composting.
{60276}{60326}What's new with composting?
{60359}{60412}- Interesting science...|- I figured it out.
{60438}{60462}By the way.
{60479}{60508}And, you know,
{60508}{60566}just so we're talking|about the same thing...
{60566}{60603}Time travel.
{60613}{60637}What?
{60737}{60766}Wow.
{60859}{60898}That's amazing...
{60921}{60951}and terrifying.
{60951}{60988}That's right.
{61162}{61207}We got really lucky.
{61207}{61235}Yeah.
{61235}{61264}I know.
{61264}{61295}A lot of people didn't.
{61295}{61335}Nope. And I can't|help everybody.
{61373}{61411}Sorta seems like you can.
{61411}{61452}Not if I stop.
{61475}{61549}I can put a pin in it|right now and stop.
{61569}{61607}Tony...
{61607}{61644}trying to get you to stop...
{61644}{61714}has been one of the few|failures of my entire life.
{61815}{61857}Something tells me...
{61887}{61909}I should put it|in a lockbox
{61909}{61952}and drop it to the bottom|of the lake...
{61980}{62008}and go to bed.
{62159}{62213}But would you be able to rest?
{62318}{62409}Okay, here we go.|Time travel test number one.
{62409}{62460}Scott, fire up...
{62483}{62510}the, uh, van thing.
{62563}{62591}Breakers are set.
{62591}{62639}Emergency generators|are on standby.
{62639}{62679}Good, because|if we blow the grid,
{62679}{62761}I don't want to lose, uh,|Tiny here in the 1950s.
{62761}{62835}- Excuse me?|- He's kidding.
{62835}{62883}You can't say things|like that.
{62883}{62929}It was a bad joke.
{62972}{63007}You were kidding, right?
{63007}{63076}I have no idea.|We're talking about time travel here.
{63076}{63137}Either it's all a joke,|or none of it is.
{63137}{63182}We're good!
{63182}{63224}Get your helmet on.
{63224}{63271}Scott, I'm gonna|send you back a week...
{63271}{63314}let you walk around|for an hour,
{63314}{63355}then bring you back|in 10 seconds.
{63355}{63397}Make sense?
{63397}{63429}Perfectly not confusing.
{63429}{63481}Good luck, Scott.|You got this.
{63511}{63588}You're right.|I do, Captain America.
{63639}{63673}On a count of three...
{63673}{63768}Three, two, one.
{63848}{63899}Uh... Guys?
{63899}{63935}This doesn't feel right.
{63935}{63962}What is this?
{63962}{63987}- What's going on?|- Who is that?
{63987}{64017}- Hold on.|- Is that Scott?
{64017}{64041}Yes, it's Scott.
{64106}{64172}- What's going on, Bruce?|- Oh, my back!
{64172}{64198}- What is this?|- Hold on a second.
{64198}{64226}Could I get|a little space here?
{64226}{64256}Yeah, yeah, yeah.|Can you bring him back?
{64256}{64283}I'm working on it.
{64450}{64472}It's a baby.
{64472}{64515}- It's Scott.|- As a baby.
{64515}{64549}- He'll grow.|- Bring Scott back.
{64549}{64593}When I say kill the power,|kill the power.
{64593}{64622}Oh, my God.
{64640}{64671}And... kill it!
{64775}{64821}Somebody peed my pants.
{64821}{64849}Oh, thank God.
{64849}{64930}But I don't know|if it was baby me or old me.
{65008}{65055}Or just me me.
{65063}{65096}Time travel!
{65187}{65211}What?
{65248}{65306}I see this as an absolute win.
{66398}{66431}Why the long face?
{66431}{66503}Let me guess,|he turned into a baby.
{66503}{66554}Among other things, yeah.|What are you doing here?
{66554}{66606}It's the EPR Paradox.
{66606}{66636}Instead of pushing Lang|through time,
{66636}{66663}you might've wound up...
{66663}{66698}pushing time through Lang.
{66698}{66726}It's tricky, dangerous.
{66726}{66767}Somebody could have|cautioned you against it.
{66767}{66798}You did.
{66798}{66829}Oh, did I?
{66829}{66871}Well, thank God|I'm here.
{66886}{66927}Regardless, I fixed it.
{66947}{67011}A fully functioning|time-space GPS.
{67055}{67089}I just want peace.
{67125}{67191}Turns out resentment|is corrosive, and I hate it.
{67213}{67249}Me, too.
{67273}{67312}We got a shot|at getting these stones,
{67312}{67362}but I gotta tell you|my priorities.
{67362}{67419}Bring back what we lost,|I hope, yes.
{67419}{67493}Keep what I found,|I have to, at all costs.
{67517}{67584}And maybe not die trying.
{67584}{67614}Would be nice.
{67671}{67696}Sounds like a deal.
{68259}{68291}Tony, I don't know.
{68291}{68330}Why?
{68331}{68378}He made it for you.
{68378}{68422}Plus, honestly,|I have to get it out of the garage
{68423}{68471}before Morgan|takes it sledding.
{68601}{68627}Thank you, Tony.
{68647}{68699}Will you keep that|a little quiet?
{68699}{68740}Didn't bring one|for the whole team.
{68779}{68859}We are getting|the whole team, yeah?
{68859}{68907}We're working|on that right now.
{69336}{69376}Hey, Humie.
{69376}{69427}Where's Big Green?
{69427}{69480}The kitchen, I think.
{69504}{69537}That's awesome.
{69565}{69618}Rhodey,|careful on re-entry.
{69618}{69660}There's an idiot|in the landing zone.
{69687}{69725}Oh, God.
{69725}{69779}<i>What's up,|Regular-Sized Man?</i>
{70994}{71057}Kind of a step down|from the golden palaces
{71057}{71098}and the magic hammers|and whatnot.
{71098}{71137}Hey, have a little|compassion, pal.
{71137}{71187}First, they lost Asgard,|then half their people.
{71187}{71230}They're probably just happy|to have a home.
{71230}{71274}You shouldn't have come.
{71274}{71314}Ah!
{71322}{71349}Valkyrie!
{71349}{71414}Great to see you,|angry girl!
{71414}{71475}I think I liked you better|either of the other ways.
{71491}{71517}This is Rocket.
{71517}{71548}How ya doing?
{71604}{71634}He won't see you.
{71635}{71662}It's that bad, huh?
{71662}{71696}We only see him|once a month
{71696}{71775}when he comes|in for "supplies."
{71801}{71835}It's that bad.
{71835}{71859}Yeah.
{72157}{72183}What the...?
{72239}{72300}Whew! Something died in here!
{72300}{72393}Hello? Thor!
{72393}{72454}Are you here|about the cable?
{72454}{72515}The Cinemax went out|two weeks ago...
{72515}{72586}and the sports are all|kinda fuzzy and whatnot.
{72601}{72630}Thor?
{72815}{72891}Boys! Oh, my God!
{72891}{72963}Oh, my God,|it's so good to see you!
{72991}{73026}Come here,|cuddly little rascal.
{73026}{73094}Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.
{73094}{73128}That's not necessary.
{73128}{73197}Hulk, you know my friends|Miek and Korg, right?
{73197}{73226}- Hey, boys!|- Hey, guys.
{73226}{73263}Long time no see.
{73263}{73289}Beer's in the bucket.
{73289}{73320}Feel free to log on|to the Wi-Fi.
{73320}{73366}No password, obviously.
{73387}{73424}Thor, he's back.
{73424}{73494}That kid on the TV just|called me a dickhead again.
{73505}{73533}Noobmaster.
{73533}{73598}Yeah, NoobMaster69|called me a dickhead.
{73598}{73647}I am sick of this.
{73647}{73686}Noobmaster, hey,|it's Thor again.
{73686}{73718}You know,|the God of Thunder.
{73718}{73775}Listen, bud, if you don't log|off this game immediately...
{73775}{73811}I am gonna fly over|to your house,
{73811}{73853}come down to that basement|you're hiding in...
{73853}{73930}rip off your arms,|and shove them up your butt!
{73930}{73952}Oh, that's right, yes!
{73952}{74002}Go cry to your father,|you little weasel.
{74016}{74042}Thank you, Thor.
{74042}{74082}Let me know if he|bothers you again, okay?
{74082}{74126}Thank you very much.|I will.
{74126}{74166}So, you guys want a drink?|What are we drinking?
{74166}{74238}I've got beer, tequila,|all sorts of things.
{74297}{74332}Buddy.
{74332}{74397}- You all right?|- Yes, I'm fine. Why?
{74397}{74430}Why, don't I look all right?
{74430}{74468}You look like|melted ice cream.
{74510}{74567}So, what's up?|You just here for a hang, or what?
{74567}{74619}- We need your help.|- Mm.
{74619}{74681}There might be a chance|we could fix everything.
{74681}{74714}What, like the cable?
{74714}{74774}'Cause that's been|driving me bananas for weeks.
{74774}{74798}Like Thanos.
{75258}{75342}Don't say that name.
{75342}{75419}Um, yeah, we don't actually|say that name in here.
{75531}{75582}Please take|your hand off me.
{75662}{75734}Now, I know that guy...
{75757}{75786}might scare you.
{75786}{75821}Why would I be...?
{75821}{75899}Why would I be scared|of that guy?
{75899}{75950}I'm the one who killed|that guy, remember?
{75950}{75979}Hmm.
{75979}{76030}Anyone else here|kill that guy?
{76110}{76135}Nope.
{76146}{76174}Didn't think so.
{76195}{76242}Korg, why don't you,|uh, tell everybody
{76242}{76298}who chopped|Thanos' big head off?
{76298}{76339}Um, Stormbreaker?
{76339}{76380}Who was swinging|Stormbreaker?
{76473}{76533}I get it. You're in|a rough spot, okay?
{76533}{76560}I've been there myself.
{76560}{76622}And you want to know|who helped me out of it?
{76622}{76690}Was it Natasha?
{76690}{76738}It was you.
{76738}{76786}You helped me.
{76814}{76851}So, why don't you ask...
{76872}{76934}the Asgardians down there...
{76934}{76977}how much my help is worth?
{77110}{77158}The ones that are left,|anyway.
{77158}{77199}I think we could|bring them back.
{77199}{77244}Stop.
{77270}{77311}Stop, okay?
{77311}{77345}I know you think I'm down here
{77345}{77384}wallowing in my own|self-pity...
{77384}{77450}waiting to be rescued|and saved...
{77450}{77508}but I'm fine, okay.|We're fine, aren't we?
{77508}{77539}Oh, we're|good here, mate.
{77539}{77594}So, whatever it is that you're|offering, we're not into it.
{77594}{77636}Don't care.|Couldn't care less.
{77636}{77666}Goodbye.
{77741}{77788}We need you, pal.
{78012}{78060}There's beer on the ship.
{78157}{78198}What kind?
{80739}{80818}What I|want you can't give me.
{81386}{81418}You shouldn't be here.
{81480}{81528}Neither should you.
{81667}{81705}I've got a job to do.
{81740}{81781}Is that what|you're calling this?
{81806}{81832}Killing all these people
{81832}{81867}isn't gonna bring|your family back.
{82003}{82034}We found something.
{82070}{82126}A chance, maybe.
{82171}{82233}Don't.
{82255}{82288}Don't what?
{82361}{82398}Don't give me hope.
{82472}{82538}I'm sorry I couldn't|give it to you sooner.
{83053}{83093}You're drifting left.
{83093}{83141}One side there, Lebowski.
{83212}{83249}Ratchet, how's it going?
{83249}{83281}It's Rocket.
{83281}{83342}Take it easy. You're only|a genius on Earth, pal.
{83453}{83498}Time travel suit,|not bad.
{83526}{83566}Hey, hey, hey!|Easy! Easy!
{83566}{83593}I'm being very careful.
{83593}{83632}No, you're being very Hulky.
{83632}{83659}I'm being careful.
{83659}{83693}These are Pym Particles,|all right?
{83693}{83729}And ever since|Hank Pym got snapped
{83729}{83759}out of existence,|this is it.
{83759}{83805}This is what we have.|We're not making any more.
{83805}{83858}- Scott, calm down.|- Sorry.
{83858}{83937}We've got enough for one|round-trip each. That's it.
{83937}{83962}No do-overs.
{83987}{84022}Plus two test runs.
{84113}{84140}One test run.
{84168}{84211}All right.|I'm not ready for this.
{84211}{84245}I'm game.
{84297}{84353}I'll do it.
{84353}{84381}Clint,|now you're gonna feel
{84381}{84421}a little discombobulated|from the chronoshift.
{84421}{84447}Don't worry about that.
{84447}{84477}Wait a second.|Let me ask you something.
{84477}{84516}If we can do this,|you know...
{84516}{84583}go back in time, why don't|we just find baby Thanos?
{84583}{84610}You know, and...
{84693}{84733}First of all,|that's horrible.
{84733}{84755}It's Thanos.
{84755}{84812}And secondly,|time doesn't work that way.
{84812}{84866}Changing the past|doesn't change the future.
{84866}{84904}Look, we go back,|we get the stones
{84904}{84936}before Thanos gets them...
{84936}{85006}Thanos doesn't have|the stones. Problem solved.
{85006}{85053}- Bingo.|- That's not how it works.
{85053}{85078}Well, that's what|I heard.
{85078}{85108}Wait, but who?|Who told you that?
{85108}{85155}<i>Star Trek,|Terminator, Timecop...</i>
{85155}{85198}- <i>Time After Time.</i>|- <i>Quantum Leap.</i>
{85198}{85225}<i>Wrinkle in Time,|Somewhere in Time.</i>
{85225}{85250}<i>Hot Tub Time Machine.</i>
{85250}{85277}<i>Hot Tub Time Machine.</i>
{85277}{85309}<i>Bill and Ted's|Excellent Adventure.</i>
{85309}{85366}Basically, any movie|that deals with time travel.
{85366}{85414}<i>Die Hard.</i>|No, that's not one.
{85414}{85442}This is known.
{85442}{85477}I don't know why|everyone believes that,
{85477}{85499}but that isn't true.
{85499}{85554}Think about it.|If you travel to the past...
{85554}{85612}that past becomes|your future...
{85612}{85686}and your former present|becomes the past...
{85686}{85759}which can't now be changed|by your new future.
{85759}{85798}Exactly.
{85798}{85873}So <i>Back to the Future</i>|is a bunch of bullshit?
{85962}{86012}All right, Clint.
{86012}{86093}We're going in three, two...
{86093}{86117}one.
{87850}{87884}Cooper?
{87884}{87925}Where are my headphones?
{87925}{87952}Lila?
{87952}{88002}- I never had them.|- Lila?
{88028}{88069}Yeah,|you had them yesterday!
{88080}{88114}Lila! Lila!
{88244}{88273}Yeah, Dad?
{88361}{88391}Dad?
{88449}{88479}Lila!
{88621}{88678}Hey. Hey, look at me.
{88678}{88723}You okay?
{88723}{88777}Yeah. Yeah.
{88818}{88850}It worked.
{88889}{88925}It worked.
{88994}{89052}Okay, so the how works.
{89052}{89145}Now, we gotta figure out|the when and the where.
{89145}{89193}Almost everyone in this room|has had an encounter...
{89193}{89237}with at least one|of the six Infinity Stones.
{89237}{89279}Or substitute|the word "encounter"...
{89279}{89306}for "damn near been killed"
{89306}{89346}by one of the six|Infinity Stones.
{89346}{89375}Well, I haven't...
{89375}{89402}but I don't even know
{89402}{89434}what the hell|you're all talking about.
{89434}{89510}Regardless, we only have|enough Pym Particles
{89510}{89557}for one round-trip each.
{89557}{89582}And these stones have been
{89582}{89637}in a lot of different places|throughout history.
{89637}{89669}Our history.
{89669}{89745}So, not a lot of convenient|spots to just drop in, yeah?
{89745}{89793}Which means we have|to pick our targets.
{89802}{89836}Correct.
{89862}{89905}So, let's start|with the Aether.
{89905}{89938}Thor, what do you know?
{90069}{90100}Is he asleep?
{90101}{90169}No, no.|I'm pretty sure he's dead.
{90237}{90279}Uh, where to start? Um...
{90316}{90388}The Aether, firstly,|is not a stone.
{90388}{90460}Someone called it|a stone before.
{90460}{90568}Um, it's more of an angry|sludge sort of a thing...
{90568}{90610}so someone's gonna need|to amend that
{90610}{90646}and stop saying that.
{90646}{90713}Here's an interesting story,|though, about the Aether.
{90713}{90761}My grandfather,|many years ago...
{90761}{90860}had to hide the stone|from the Dark Elves.
{90860}{90920}Ooh.|Scary beings.
{90921}{90963}So, Jane, actually...
{90974}{91017}Oh, there she is.
{91017}{91124}Yeah, so Jane was|an old flame of mine.
{91124}{91204}You know, she stuck her hand|inside a rock this one time...
{91205}{91286}and then the Aether|stuck itself inside her...
{91286}{91328}and she became|very, very sick.
{91329}{91380}And so I had to|take her to Asgard,
{91381}{91411}which is where I'm from...
{91411}{91461}and we had to try|and fix her.
{91461}{91500}We were dating at the time,|you see...
{91501}{91589}and I got to introduce her|to my mother...
{91615}{91669}who's dead and, um...
{91701}{91736}Oh, you know, Jane and I
{91737}{91788}aren't even|dating anymore, so...
{91811}{91845}Yes, these things happen,|though. You know?
{91845}{91876}Nothing lasts forever.|The only thing that...
{91876}{91924}- Why don't you come sit down?|- I'm not done yet.
{91924}{91965}The only thing|that is permanent in life
{91965}{92001}is impermanence.
{92016}{92077}Awesome.|Eggs? Breakfast?
{92077}{92124}No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.
{92125}{92200}Quill said he stole|the Power Stone from Morag.
{92201}{92272}- Is that a person?|- No, Morag's a planet.
{92290}{92336}Quill was a person.
{92336}{92398}Like a planet?|Like in outer space?
{92398}{92432}Oh, look.
{92432}{92501}It's like a little puppy,|all happy and everything.
{92501}{92584}Do you wanna go to space?|You wanna go to space, puppy?
{92585}{92616}I'll take you to space.
{92642}{92696}Thanos found|the Soul Stone on Vormir.
{92697}{92742}What is Vormir?
{92742}{92788}A dominion of death...
{92788}{92838}at the very center|of celestial existence.
{92880}{92980}It's where Thanos|murdered my sister.
{93133}{93157}Not it.
{93197}{93240}- That Time Stone guy.|- Doctor Strange.
{93240}{93287}Yeah, what kind|of doctor was he?
{93287}{93338}Ear-nose-throat|meets rabbit-from-hat.
{93338}{93375}Nice place|in the Village, though.
{93375}{93413}Yeah,|on Sullivan Street?
{93413}{93445}Mm... Bleecker Street.
{93445}{93482}Wait, he lived|in New York?
{93482}{93508}No,|he lived in Toronto.
{93508}{93535}Uh, yeah, on Bleecker|and Sullivan.
{93535}{93565}Have you been listening|to anything?
{93565}{93591}Guys.
{93591}{93629}If you pick|the right year,
{93629}{93675}there are three stones|in New York.
{93732}{93774}Shut the front door.
{93837}{93890}All right.|We have a plan.
{93890}{94007}Six stones, three teams,|one shot.
{94232}{94282}<i>Five years ago,|we lost.</i>
{94312}{94347}<i>All of us.</i>
{94389}{94424}<i>We lost friends.</i>
{94438}{94480}<i>We lost family.</i>
{94527}{94572}<i>We lost a part of ourselves.</i>
{94600}{94664}<i>Today, we have a chance|to take it all back.</i>
{94691}{94780}<i>You know your teams.|You know your missions.</i>
{94780}{94832}<i>Get the stones.|Get them back.</i>
{94848}{94883}One round-trip each.
{94883}{94908}No mistakes...
{94919}{94964}no do-overs.
{94964}{95008}Most of us are going|somewhere we know.
{95008}{95062}That doesn't mean|we should know what to expect.
{95085}{95113}Be careful.
{95126}{95160}Look out for each other.
{95188}{95236}This is the fight|of our lives...
{95253}{95293}and we're gonna win.
{95344}{95373}Whatever it takes.
{95445}{95486}Good luck.
{95486}{95515}He's pretty good at that.
{95515}{95545}- Right?|- All right.
{95545}{95571}You heard the man.
{95571}{95604}Stroke those keys,|Jolly Green.
{95623}{95677}Trackers engaged.
{95677}{95730}You promise to bring that|back in one piece, right?
{95730}{95768}Yeah, yeah, yeah.
{95768}{95812}Okay, I'll do my best.
{95812}{95861}As promises go,|that was pretty lame.
{95921}{95961}See ya in a minute.
{97264}{97297}All right, we all have|our assignments.
{97297}{97353}Two stones uptown,|one stone down.
{97353}{97405}Stay low. Keep an eye|on the clock.
{97772}{97821}Maybe smash a few things|along the way.
{97843}{97896}I think it's gratuitous,|but whatever.
{98552}{98592}I'd be careful|going that way.
{98592}{98637}We just had|the floors waxed.
{98759}{98800}Yeah, I'm looking|for Doctor Strange.
{98835}{98924}You're about|five years too early.
{98924}{98976}Stephen Strange is currently|performing surgery
{98976}{99015}about 20 blocks that way.
{99059}{99083}What do you want from him?
{99105}{99129}That, actually.
{99152}{99178}Ah!
{99205}{99237}I'm afraid not.
{99237}{99273}Sorry, but I wasn't asking.
{99291}{99322}You don't want|to do this.
{99322}{99361}Ah, you're right, I don't.|But I need that stone...
{99361}{99400}and I don't have time|to debate it.
{99616}{99656}Let's start over, shall we?
{99930}{99967}For you, Lady Jane.
{99967}{100030}Um, so you have|anything with pants?
{100030}{100062}Pants?
{100062}{100111}Never mind.|These will be fine. Thank you.
{100111}{100156}- Yes, milady.|- Oh, there's Jane.
{100192}{100221}All right.
{100252}{100288}Here's the deal, tubby.
{100288}{100316}You're gonna charm her,
{100316}{100350}and I'm gonna poke her|with this thing...
{100350}{100412}and extract the Reality Stone,|and get gone lickety-split.
{100452}{100480}I'll be right back, okay?
{100480}{100521}The wine cellar|is just down here.
{100521}{100594}My father used to have this|huge barrel of Aakonian ale.
{100594}{100632}I'll see if the scullery|has a couple of to-go cups.
{100632}{100678}Hey. Hey! Aren't you|drunk enough already?
{100852}{100882}If you could send Loki|some soup.
{100882}{100908}Yes, milady.
{100908}{100932}And ask our librarians
{100932}{101002}to pull some volumes|from the astronomy shelf.
{101149}{101188}Who's the fancy broad?
{101219}{101257}That's my mother.
{101267}{101309}She dies today.
{101322}{101366}Oh, that is today?
{101520}{101595}I can't do this.|I can't do this.
{101595}{101637}I shouldn't be here.|I shouldn't have come.
{101637}{101669}It's a bad idea!
{101669}{101697}- Come here.|- No, no, no.
{101697}{101759}I think I'm having|a panic attack.
{101760}{101785}Come here. Right here.
{101785}{101829}I shouldn't be here.|This is bad.
{101829}{101873}You think you're the|only one who lost people?
{101873}{101921}What do you think|we're doing here?
{101921}{101975}I lost the only family|I ever had.
{101976}{102040}Quill, Groot, Drax,|the chick with the antenna...
{102040}{102090}all gone.
{102090}{102131}I get you miss|your mom...
{102131}{102162}but she's gone.
{102162}{102197}Really gone.
{102197}{102274}And there are plenty of people|who are only kind of gone...
{102274}{102300}and you can help them.
{102327}{102362}So, is it too much to ask
{102362}{102406}that you brush the crumbs|out of your beard...
{102406}{102468}make schmoopy talk|to Pretty Pants...
{102468}{102546}and when she's not looking,|suck out the Infinity Stone...
{102546}{102586}and help me|get my family back?
{102614}{102657}Okay.
{102657}{102681}Are you crying?
{102693}{102728}No.
{102772}{102798}Yes.
{102798}{102834}I feel like|I'm losing it.
{102834}{102859}Get it together!
{102860}{102885}You can do this.
{102911}{102948}You can do this.
{103023}{103050}All right?
{103050}{103077}Yes, I can.
{103077}{103106}Good.
{103153}{103212}I can do this. I can do this.
{103233}{103269}I can't do this.
{103269}{103316}All right, heartbreaker,|she's alone.
{103316}{103357}This is our shot.
{103357}{103421}Thor? Thor!
{103662}{103700}All right,|bring it down, Blue.
{103700}{103761}Right on that line.|That's it. Down, down.
{103872}{103915}Hey, can we hurry it up?
{103915}{103967}Guys, chop-chop. Come on.|We're on the clock.
{103967}{104015}All that is really helpful.
{104063}{104099}- Take care, okay?|- Yeah.
{104100}{104176}Get that stone and come back.|No messing around.
{104176}{104216}- Hey.|- We got this.
{104216}{104252}- Let's get it done.|- Yes, sir.
{104252}{104300}I'll see you back.
{104300}{104336}You guys watch|each other's six.
{104348}{104382}Yeah.
{104587}{104626}Coordinates|for Vormir are laid in.
{104662}{104713}All they have to do|is not fall out.
{104851}{104912}We're a long way|from Budapest.
{105023}{105086}Okay, so, uh...
{105086}{105170}we just wait around for|this Quill guy to show up...
{105170}{105219}and then he leads us to the Power|Stone, is that it?
{105239}{105275}Let's take cover.
{105307}{105370}We're not the only ones in|2014 looking for the stones.
{105370}{105408}Wait a minute.|What are you talking about right now?
{105408}{105443}Who else is looking|for these stones?
{105527}{105567}My father...
{105567}{105615}my sister...
{105615}{105644}and me.
{105644}{105676}And you?
{105717}{105757}Where are you right now?
{106442}{106477}You're welcome.
{106477}{106548}I didn't ask for your help.
{106548}{106589}And yet, you always need it.
{106681}{106737}Get up. Father wants us|back on the ship.
{106737}{106764}Why?
{106764}{106812}He's found an Infinity Stone.
{106918}{106955}Where?
{106955}{107002}On a planet|called Morag.
{107038}{107087}Father's plan|is finally in motion.
{107087}{107143}One stone isn't six, Nebula.
{107143}{107175}It's a start.
{107175}{107219}If he gets all of them...
{107526}{107571}Ronan's located|the Power Stone.
{107571}{107616}I'm dispatching you|to his ship.
{107616}{107652}He won't like that.
{107652}{107703}His alternative is death.
{107737}{107784}Ronan's obsession...
{107804}{107860}clouds his judgment.
{107964}{108008}We will not fail you, Father.
{108033}{108074}No, you won't.
{108135}{108159}I swear...
{108205}{108251}I will make you proud.
{108446}{108539}<i>...we just wait around for|this Quill guy to show up...</i>
{108539}{108595}<i>and then he leads us to the|Power Stone, is that it?</i>
{108595}{108654}<i>Let's take cover.</i>
{108654}{108699}<i>We're not the only ones|in 2014</i>
{108699}{108728}<i>looking for the stones.</i>
{108784}{108820}Who was that?
{108820}{108847}I don't know.
{108847}{108903}My head is splitting.|I don't know.
{108936}{109012}Her synaptic drive was|probably damaged in battle.
{109025}{109060}Shh.
{109257}{109306}Bring her to my ship.
{109483}{109515}Better hustle, Cap.
{109515}{109556}Things look like they're|just about wrapped up here.
{109556}{109608}<i>Got it.|I'm approaching the elevator now.</i>
{109756}{109801}If it's all|the same to you...
{109850}{109899}I'll have|that drink now.
{109899}{109940}All right,|get him on his feet.
{109940}{110015}We can all stand around|posing up a storm later.
{110015}{110052}By the way, feel free|to clean up.
{110052}{110129}Mr. Rogers,|I almost forgot that that suit...
{110129}{110168}did nothing for your ass.
{110168}{110206}<i>No one|asked you to look, Tony.</i>
{110206}{110233}It's ridiculous.
{110233}{110264}<i>I think|you look great, Cap.</i>
{110264}{110324}<i>As far as I'm concerned,|that's America's ass.</i>
{110324}{110371}Who gets|the, uh, magic wand?
{110371}{110400}S.T.R.I.K.E. team's
{110400}{110432}coming to secure it.
{110666}{110712}We can take that|off your hands.
{110712}{110741}By all means.
{110794}{110835}Careful with that thing.
{110835}{110875}Yeah, unless you want|your mind erased.
{110875}{110902}And not in a fun way.
{110902}{110931}We promise to be careful.
{110931}{110962}<i>Who are these guys?</i>
{110962}{110990}They are S.H.I.E.L.D.
{110990}{111071}Well, actually Hydra,|but we didn't know that yet.
{111071}{111126}<i>Seriously?|You didn't?</i>
{111126}{111167}<i>I mean, they look|like bad guys.</i>
{111167}{111203}You're small,|but you're talking loud.
{111203}{111251}On my way down to coordinate|search and rescue.
{111251}{111301}On my way down to coordinate|search and rescue.
{111301}{111371}I mean, honestly,|how do you keep your food down?
{111371}{111414}Shut up.
{111414}{111451}Ooh. All right, you're up,|little buddy.
{111451}{111505}There's our stone.
{111505}{111537}<i>All right.</i>
{111537}{111564}<i>Flick me.</i>
{111902}{111929}- Move.|- Hey.
{111929}{111971}- Whoa, whoa, whoa!|- Hey, hey. Buddy!
{111971}{112021}What do you think?|Maximum occupancy has been reached.
{112021}{112050}Take the stairs.
{112050}{112091}Yeah. Stop, stop.
{112158}{112247}"Take the stairs."|Hate the stairs.
{112311}{112379}All right, Cap, I got|our scepter in the elevator...
{112379}{112423}just passing the 80th floor.
{112443}{112467}On it.
{112479}{112507}Head to the lobby.
{112507}{112536}<i>All right,|I'll see you there.</i>
{112536}{112579}Evidence secure.
{112579}{112630}We're en route|to Doctor List.
{112630}{112704}No. No hitches at all,|Mr. Secretary.
{112827}{112848}Captain.
{112848}{112881}I thought|you were coordinating
{112881}{112902}search and rescue.
{112902}{112946}Change of plans.
{113034}{113071}Hey, Cap.
{113100}{113125}Rumlow.
{113275}{113323}I just got a call|from the secretary.
{113323}{113373}I'm gonna be running point|on the scepter.
{113426}{113483}Sir? I don't understand.
{113540}{113588}We got word there may be|an attempt to steal it.
{113588}{113631}Sorry, Cap.
{113631}{113674}We can't give you|the scepter.
{113675}{113728}I'm gonna have to call|the director.
{113728}{113783}That's okay. Trust me.
{113865}{113889}Hail Hydra.
{114239}{114286}So many stairs!
{114562}{114634}Thumbelina, do you copy?|I've got eyes on the prize.
{114635}{114657}It is go time.
{114657}{114687}<i>Bombs away.</i>
{114860}{114918}<i>Is that Axe Body Spray?</i>
{114919}{114978}Yeah, I had a can in the desk|for emergencies. Relax.
{114979}{115007}Can we focus, please?
{115007}{115041}<i>I'm going inside you...</i>
{115059}{115083}<i>now.</i>
{115220}{115256}Uh, may I ask you|where you're going?
{115256}{115317}Bit of lunch and then Asgard.|I'm sorry, you are...?
{115317}{115344}Alexander Pierce.
{115344}{115380}He's the man|above the folks
{115380}{115409}- behind Nick Fury.|- Oh.
{115409}{115438}My friends call me|Mr. Secretary.
{115438}{115464}I'm gonna have to ask you
{115464}{115495}to turn that prisoner|over to me.
{115495}{115542}Uh, Loki will be answering|to Odin himself.
{115543}{115574}No, he's going|to answer to us.
{115575}{115607}Odin can have what's left.
{115607}{115643}And I'm gonna need|that case.
{115643}{115695}That's been S.H.I.E.L.D.|property for over 70 years.
{115695}{115726}Hand over the case, Stark.
{115726}{115756}All right,|move it, Stuart Little.
{115756}{115789}Things are getting dicey|out here. Let's go.
{115789}{115841}I'm not gonna argue who's got|the higher authority here...
{115841}{115874}<i>You promise me|you won't die?</i>
{115874}{115943}We're only giving me|a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.
{115943}{115986}<i>That doesn't sound mild.</i>
{115987}{116014}I need the case.
{116014}{116046}I know you got a lot of|pull, I'm just saying,
{116046}{116083}- jurisdiction...|- Okay, then give me the case.
{116083}{116109}Well, jurisdiction...

{116524}{116562}Speak to me.
{116562}{116606}Stark,|is it your chest machine?
{116673}{116703}Breathe, breathe.
{116828}{116858}Good job.|Meet me in the alley.
{116858}{116887}I'm gonna grab|a quick slice.
{117021}{117070}No stairs!
{117234}{117290}Uh... Come on, Stark,|stay with us.
{117290}{117316}I'm going to|try something. Okay?
{117316}{117361}I have no idea|if it's going to work.
{117361}{117419}Yes!
{117419}{117454}Oh, that worked a treat.
{117454}{117481}Dude, that was so crazy.
{117481}{117520}I had no idea|if that was gonna work.
{117520}{117569}- The case.|- The case is, uh...
{117569}{117622}Where's the case?|Where's Loki?
{117641}{117673}Loki!
{117673}{117706}<i>That wasn't|supposed to happen, was it?</i>
{117706}{117733}Oh, we blew it.
{117733}{117768}Loki?
{117815}{117850}Tony, what's going on?
{117869}{117915}Tell me you found that Cube.
{117980}{118017}Oh, you gotta be|shitting me.
{118110}{118170}I have eyes on Loki.|14th floor.
{118170}{118206}I'm not Loki...
{118289}{118330}and I don't wanna|hurt you.
{118539}{118571}I can do this all day.
{118571}{118604}Yeah, I know.
{118604}{118633}I know.
{119414}{119438}Where did you get this?
{119708}{119786}Bucky is alive.
{119868}{119893}What?
{120251}{120290}That is America's ass.
{120394}{120416}Please, please.
{120416}{120466}I'm sorry,|I can't help you, Bruce.
{120486}{120523}If I give up|the Time Stone
{120523}{120569}to help your reality,|I'm dooming my own.
{120569}{120610}With all due respect,|all right...
{120610}{120694}I'm not sure the science|really supports that.
{120826}{120870}The Infinity Stones create
{120870}{120930}what you experience|as the flow of time.
{120930}{120973}Remove one of the stones...
{120973}{121026}and that flow splits.
{121026}{121086}Now, this may benefit|your reality...
{121086}{121148}but my new one,|not so much.
{121148}{121194}In this new branch reality...
{121194}{121237}without our chief weapon
{121237}{121275}against the forces|of darkness...
{121275}{121330}our world would be overrun.
{121330}{121375}Millions will suffer.
{121375}{121415}So, tell me, Doctor.
{121415}{121474}Can your science|prevent all that?
{121474}{121498}No...
{121522}{121547}but we can erase it.
{121547}{121593}Because once we're done|with the stones...
{121593}{121652}we can return each one|to its own timeline...
{121652}{121694}at the moment it was taken.
{121694}{121755}So, chronologically...
{121775}{121805}in that reality...
{121864}{121906}it never left.
{121956}{122039}Yes, but you're leaving out|the most important part.
{122118}{122182}In order to return the stones,|you have to survive.
{122182}{122262}We will. I will.|I promise.
{122262}{122316}I can't risk this reality|on a promise.
{122353}{122422}It's the duty|of the Sorcerer Supreme
{122422}{122473}to protect the Time Stone.
{122473}{122523}Then why the hell|did Strange give it away?
{122566}{122594}What did you say?
{122594}{122654}Strange. He gave it away.|He gave it to Thanos.
{122666}{122710}- Willingly?|- Yes.
{122800}{122843}- Why?|- I have no idea.
{122843}{122886}Maybe he made a mistake.
{123129}{123158}Or I did.
{123643}{123702}Strange is meant to be|the best of us.
{123702}{123770}So, he must've done it|for a reason.
{123785}{123826}I fear you might be right.
{123949}{123973}Thank you.
{124122}{124163}I'm counting on you, Bruce.
{124212}{124245}We all are.
{124729}{124773}Run diagnostics.
{124787}{124834}Show me her memory file.
{124870}{124931}Sire, the file|appears entangled.
{124958}{125006}It was a memory,|but not hers.
{125034}{125074}There's another|consciousness...
{125074}{125109}sharing her network.
{125119}{125150}Another Nebula.
{125200}{125236}Impossible.
{125236}{125323}This duplicate|carries a time stamp...
{125323}{125379}from nine years|in the future.
{125486}{125561}Where is this other Nebula?
{125562}{125614}In our|solar system on Morag.
{125649}{125681}Can you access her?
{125682}{125733}Yes,|the two are linked.
{125734}{125786}Search the duplicate's|memories...
{125786}{125843}for Infinity Stones.
{125926}{125957}<i>And these stones have been</i>
{125958}{126000}<i>in a lot of different places|throughout history.</i>
{126000}{126027}<i>Our history.</i>
{126027}{126085}<i>So, not a lot|of convenient spots</i>
{126086}{126113}<i>to just drop in.</i>
{126113}{126155}<i>Which means|we have to pick our targets.</i>
{126155}{126194}- <i>Correct.</i>|- Freeze image.

{126295}{126337}Avengers.
{126358}{126403}Unruly wretches.
{126403}{126442}What's that reflection?
{126477}{126510}Amplify this, Maw.
{126591}{126624}I don't understand.
{126734}{126772}Two Nebulas.
{126772}{126837}No.|The same Nebula...
{126853}{126896}from two different times.
{126926}{126965}Set course for Morag.
{126965}{127029}And scan|the duplicate's memories.
{127044}{127104}I wanna see everything.
{127337}{127385}My ladies,|I'll see you after.
{127386}{127422}I'll see you after.|Go on ahead.
{127765}{127791}What are you doing?
{127820}{127857}Oh, God!
{127857}{127921}You're better off leaving|the sneaking to your brother.
{127921}{127969}No, I wasn't sneaking.|I was just going for a walk.
{127969}{128003}What are you wearing?
{128003}{128065}I always wear this.|It's one of my favorites.
{128134}{128161}Mm...
{128161}{128200}What's wrong|with your eye?
{128200}{128227}Oh, my eye.
{128227}{128277}Remember the, uh,|Battle of Harokin...
{128277}{128308}when I got hit|in the face
{128308}{128356}with the broadsword?
{128433}{128486}You're not the Thor|I know at all, are you?
{128505}{128553}Yes, I am.
{128553}{128625}The future hasn't been kind|to you, has it?
{128625}{128685}I didn't say|I was from the future.
{128685}{128768}I was raised by witches, boy.
{128768}{128833}I see with more than eyes,|you know that.
{128877}{128938}Yeah,|I'm totally from the future.
{128938}{128977}Yes, you are, honey.
{128977}{129019}I really need|to talk to you.
{129019}{129048}We can talk.
{129621}{129685}His head was over there...
{129685}{129767}and his body over there...
{129767}{129853}I mean, what was|the point? I was too late.
{129853}{129893}I was just standing there.
{129912}{129958}Some idiot with an axe.
{129958}{130005}Now,|you're no idiot.
{130027}{130066}You're here, aren't you?
{130066}{130139}Seeking counsel from|the wisest person in Asgard.
{130139}{130167}I am. Yes.
{130167}{130205}Idiot, no.
{130205}{130242}A failure?
{130242}{130272}Absolutely.
{130272}{130319}That's a little bit harsh.
{130319}{130357}Do you know|what that makes you?
{130385}{130437}Just like everyone else.
{130437}{130493}I'm not supposed to be|like everyone else, am I?
{130493}{130521}Mm.
{130521}{130609}Everyone fails at who|they're supposed to be, Thor.
{130609}{130685}The measure of a person,|of a hero...
{130685}{130774}is how well they succeed|at being who they are.
{130894}{130932}I've really|missed you, Mom.
{131073}{131117}Thor! I got it!
{131133}{131173}Get that rabbit!
{131240}{131288}Mom, I have to|tell you something.
{131288}{131330}No, son, you don't.
{131330}{131396}You're here to repair|your future, not mine.
{131396}{131439}This is about your future.
{131439}{131476}Uh, it's none of|my business.
{131572}{131604}Hi.
{131604}{131650}You must be Mom.
{131650}{131691}I got the thing.|Come on. We gotta move.
{131691}{131732}Oh, I wish|we had more time.
{131732}{131780}No, this was a gift.
{131780}{131873}Now you go and be the man|you're meant to be.
{131873}{131901}I love you, Mom.
{131901}{131929}I love you.
{132034}{132081}And eat a salad.
{132105}{132134}Come on, we gotta go.
{132134}{132177}- Goodbye.|- Three...
{132177}{132203}- Two...|- No, wait!
{132280}{132311}What am I looking at?
{132311}{132349}Oh, sometimes|it takes a second.
{132574}{132627}I'm still worthy.
{132659}{132700}Oh, boy.
{132722}{132773}- Goodbye, Mom.|- Goodbye.
{133713}{133754}So, he's an idiot?
{133785}{133821}Yeah.
{134023}{134054}What's that?
{134054}{134100}The tool of a thief.
{134284}{134330}Whoa, whoa, whoa.
{134330}{134374}This is the part|where spikes come out...
{134374}{134414}with skeletons on the end|of them and everything.
{134414}{134445}What are you|talking about?
{134445}{134472}When you break into|a place called
{134472}{134503}"The Temple|of the Power Stone"...
{134503}{134541}there's gonna be|a bunch of booby traps.
{134541}{134598}- Oh, my God.|- Okay. All right. Go ahead.
{135395}{135433}I wasn't always like this.
{135451}{135480}Me either.
{135519}{135557}But we work|with what we got, right?
{135594}{135625}Hmm.
{135643}{135685}Let's sync up.
{135730}{135792}Three, two, one.
{136096}{136135}<i>You murdered trillions!</i>
{136135}{136171}<i>You should be grateful.</i>
{136208}{136256}<i>Where are the stones?</i>
{136256}{136280}<i>Gone.</i>
{136294}{136336}<i>Reduced to atoms.</i>
{136337}{136379}<i>You used them|two days ago!</i>
{136379}{136459}<i>I used the stones|to destroy the stones.</i>
{136459}{136507}<i>It nearly killed me.</i>
{136507}{136556}<i>But the work is done.</i>
{136557}{136606}<i>It always will be.</i>
{136631}{136717}<i>I am inevitable.</i>
{136745}{136797}What did you do|to them?
{136797}{136831}Nothing.
{136853}{136882}Yet.
{136921}{136969}They're not trying|to stop something
{136969}{137018}I'm going to do|in our time.
{137018}{137068}They're trying|to undo something
{137068}{137110}I've already done|in theirs.
{137110}{137157}The stones.
{137174}{137220}I found them all.
{137265}{137310}I won.
{137310}{137386}Tipped the cosmic scales|to balance.
{137482}{137532}This is your future.
{137532}{137580}It's my destiny.
{137609}{137660}<i>My father is many things.</i>
{137661}{137710}<i>A liar is not one of them.</i>
{137747}{137771}<i>Ah.</i>
{137796}{137845}<i>Thank you, daughter.</i>
{137845}{137903}<i>Perhaps I treated you|too harshly.</i>
{138002}{138077}And that is|destiny fulfilled.
{138084}{138119}Sire...
{138119}{138157}your daughter...
{138207}{138240}No!
{138240}{138268}...is a traitor.
{138268}{138332}That's not me.|It's not, I could never...
{138332}{138368}I would never betray you.
{138368}{138412}Never. Never.
{138547}{138597}I know.
{138597}{138679}And you'll have the chance|to prove it.
{138828}{138854}No!
{138872}{138900}He knows!
{139008}{139061}Barton! Barton, come in.
{139073}{139120}Romanoff!
{139120}{139160}Come in, we have a problem.
{139160}{139189}Come on!
{139189}{139229}Come in, we have a...
{139229}{139260}Thanos knows.
{139277}{139306}Thanos...
{139636}{139662}Cap.
{139698}{139753}Sorry, buddy,|we got a problem.
{139753}{139818}Yeah, we do.
{139818}{139847}Well,|what are we gonna do now?
{139847}{139872}You know what?|Give me a break, Steve.
{139872}{139905}I just got hit in the head|with the Hulk.
{139905}{139952}You said|that we had one shot.
{139952}{139981}This was our shot.
{139981}{140032}We shot it. It's shot.|Six stones or nothing.
{140032}{140072}- It was six stones or nothing.|- You're repeating yourself,
{140072}{140104}you know that?|You're repeating yourself.
{140104}{140147}You're repeating yourself.|You're repeating yourself.
{140147}{140168}Dude. Come on!
{140168}{140195}No. You never wanted|a time heist.
{140195}{140231}You weren't on board|with the time heist.
{140231}{140256}- I dropped the ball.|- You ruined the time heist.
{140256}{140286}- Is that what I did?|- Yeah.
{140286}{140333}Are there any other options|with the Tesseract?
{140333}{140369}No, no, no, there's|no other options.
{140369}{140403}There's no do-overs.
{140403}{140456}We're not going anywhere else.|We have one particle left.
{140456}{140478}Each.
{140478}{140540}That's it. All right?|We use that...
{140540}{140571}bye-bye,|you're not going home.
{140571}{140620}Yeah, well,|if we don't try...
{140620}{140656}then no one else|is going home, either.
{140656}{140684}I got it.
{140708}{140762}There's another way|to retake the Tesseract
{140762}{140825}and acquire new particles.
{140825}{140865}Little stroll down|memory lane.
{140865}{140915}Military installation,|Garden State.
{141012}{141040}When were they both there?
{141040}{141118}They were there at a time...|I have a vaguely exact idea.
{141118}{141144}- How vague?|- What are you talking about?
{141144}{141171}Where are we going?
{141171}{141196}I know for a fact|they were there.
{141196}{141226}Who's they?|What are we doing?
{141226}{141252}And I know how I know.
{141298}{141348}Guys, what is it?
{141348}{141388}Looks like|we're improvising.
{141388}{141422}- Great.|- What are we improvising?
{141422}{141468}Scott, get this back|to the compound.
{141468}{141497}Suit up.
{141497}{141536}- What's in New Jersey?|- 0-4.
{141536}{141562}0-4.

{141589}{141644}- Excuse me.|- 1-9-7-0.
{141644}{141669}Are you sure?

{141707}{141755}Steve? Sorry.
{141755}{141794}America. Rogers.
{141794}{141828}Look, if you do this...
{141828}{141896}and it doesn't work,|you're not coming back.
{141916}{141965}Thanks for the pep talk,|pissant.
{141990}{142018}You trust me?
{142040}{142067}I do.
{142092}{142127}Your call.
{142144}{142186}Here we go.
{142566}{142660}Hey, man!|Make love, not war.
{142797}{142866}Clearly you weren't|actually born here, right?
{142866}{142927}The idea of me was.
{142927}{142970}Right. Well,|imagine you're S.H.I.E.L.D...
{142970}{143051}running a quasi-fascistic|intelligence organization...
{143081}{143124}where do you hide it?
{143124}{143166}In plain sight.
{143840}{143875}Good luck|on your mission, Captain.
{143875}{143938}Good luck|on your project, Doctor.
{144018}{144048}You new here?
{144107}{144142}Not exactly.
{144300}{144344}Come on, you bastard.
{144508}{144541}Gotcha.
{144659}{144683}Whew.
{144959}{145005}Back in the game.
{145066}{145094}Arnim, you in there?
{145117}{145142}Arnim?
{145268}{145316}Hey!
{145316}{145358}The door is this way, pal.
{145379}{145403}Oh, yeah.
{145403}{145451}Looking for Doctor Zola,|have you seen him?
{145451}{145540}Yeah, Doctor Zola.|No, I haven't seen a soul.
{145574}{145609}Pardon me.
{145624}{145664}Do I know you?

{148740}{148831}I guess I'll be eating|dinner in the pantry again.
{148848}{148880}I have a little girl.
{148880}{148917}A girl would be nice.
{148917}{148983}Less of a chance she'd|turn out exactly like me.
{148983}{149019}What'd be so awful|about that?
{149019}{149068}Let's just say|that the greater good
{149068}{149151}has rarely outweighed|my own self-interest.
{149243}{149283}And you've never seen|these two men before?
{149283}{149323}No, I've got an eye for this.|The two of them looked fishy.
{149324}{149349}Can you describe them?
{149349}{149380}One of them|had a hippie beard.
{149380}{149434}Hippie.|Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?
{149434}{149467}Definitely Mungo Jerry.
{149467}{149493}Yeah, this is Chesler.
{149493}{149521}I need every available MP|to sublevel six.
{149521}{149571}We have|a potential breach.
{149996}{150024}I said bring them in.
{150024}{150051}They're trying, ma'am,|but Braddock's unit
{150051}{150079}has been stopped|by lightning strikes.
{150079}{150101}Oh, for the love of...
{150101}{150144}I'll look at|the weather projections.
{150715}{150768}It's not lightning strikes|we're looking at.
{151034}{151079}So, where you at|with names?
{151079}{151157}Well, if it's a boy,|my wife likes Elmonzo.
{151157}{151211}Huh. Might wanna|let that stew awhile.
{151211}{151248}- You got time.|- Uh-huh.
{151275}{151337}Let me ask you|a question.
{151337}{151417}When your kid was born,|were you nervous?
{151417}{151457}Wildly.
{151457}{151503}- Yeah.|- Did you feel qualified?
{151503}{151545}Like you had any idea
{151545}{151594}how to successfully operate|that thing?
{151594}{151671}I literally pieced it|together as I went along.
{151671}{151727}I thought about|what my dad did.
{151727}{151759}My old man,
{151759}{151803}he never met a problem he|couldn't solve with a belt.
{151803}{151860}I thought my dad|was tough on me.
{151860}{151892}And now,|looking back on it,
{151892}{151925}I just remember|the good stuff.
{151925}{151968}You know? He did drop|the odd pearl.
{151968}{152026}Yeah? Like what?
{152026}{152093}"No amount of money ever|bought a second of time."
{152123}{152156}Smart guy.
{152156}{152194}He did his best.
{152225}{152260}I'll tell you,|that kid's not even here yet
{152260}{152325}and there's nothing|I wouldn't do for him.
{152531}{152567}Good to meet you, Potts.
{152577}{152601}Yeah.
{152609}{152647}Howard...
{152647}{152692}everything's gonna be|all right.
{152764}{152793}Thank you...
{152816}{152855}for everything...
{152855}{152913}you've done|for this country.
{152983}{153009}Jarvis.
{153095}{153134}Have we ever met|that guy?
{153182}{153220}You meet|a lot of people, sir.
{153280}{153321}Seems very familiar.
{153343}{153381}Weird beard.
{153567}{153603}You're weak.
{153614}{153644}I'm you.
{154059}{154119}You could stop this.
{154119}{154177}You know you want to.
{154177}{154233}Did you see what happens|in the future?
{154263}{154323}Thanos finds the Soul Stone.
{154352}{154405}You wanna know|how he does that?
{154436}{154540}You wanna know|what he does to you?
{154550}{154583}That's enough.
{154879}{154919}You disgust me.
{154944}{155067}But that doesn't mean|you're useless.
{155583}{155626}How do I look?
{155786}{155810}Wow.
{155829}{155907}Under different|circumstances...
{155907}{155959}this would be|totally awesome.
{156241}{156279}I bet the raccoon
{156279}{156317}didn't have to climb|a mountain.
{156317}{156365}Technically he's not|a raccoon, you know?
{156365}{156409}Oh, whatever.|He eats garbage.
{156409}{156444}Welcome.
{156519}{156553}Natasha.
{156553}{156582}Daughter of Ivan.
{156612}{156642}Clint.
{156642}{156700}Son of Edith.
{156827}{156877}Who are you?
{156877}{156942}Consider me a guide...
{156942}{156982}to you...
{156982}{157030}and to all who seek|the Soul Stone.
{157030}{157061}Oh, good.
{157061}{157113}You tell us where it is,|then we'll be on our way.
{157203}{157260}If only it were that easy.
{157545}{157640}What you seek|lies in front of you.
{157669}{157730}As does what you fear.
{157843}{157906}The stone's down there.
{157906}{157958}For one of you.
{157958}{158000}For the other...
{158061}{158110}In order to take|the stone...
{158111}{158187}you must lose|that which you love.
{158219}{158294}An everlasting exchange.
{158318}{158420}A soul for a soul.
{158475}{158543}How's it going?
{158595}{158634}Jesus.
{158634}{158676}Maybe he's making|this shit up.
{158698}{158733}No.
{158749}{158786}I don't think so.
{158787}{158843}Why? 'Cause he knows|your daddy's name?
{158876}{158906}I didn't.
{158935}{158999}Thanos left here|with the stone...
{159012}{159050}without his daughter.
{159050}{159104}That's not a coincidence.
{159130}{159171}Yeah.
{159208}{159254}Whatever it takes.
{159359}{159398}Whatever it takes.
{159501}{159551}If we don't get that stone...
{159551}{159598}billions of people stay dead.
{159615}{159646}Yeah.
{159683}{159742}Then I guess we both know|who it's gotta be.
{159757}{159789}I guess we do.
{159984}{160027}I'm starting to think
{160027}{160108}we mean different|people here, Natasha.
{160108}{160161}For the last five years,|I've been trying to do one thing.
{160161}{160188}Get to right here.
{160188}{160244}That's all it's been about.|Bringing everybody back.
{160244}{160299}No, don't you get|all decent on me now.
{160299}{160363}What, you think|I wanna do it?
{160363}{160410}I'm trying to save your life,|you idiot.
{160410}{160486}Yeah, well, I don't|want you to. How's that?
{160486}{160543}Natasha, you know|what I've done.
{160580}{160629}You know what I've become.
{160674}{160702}Oh, I don't judge people
{160702}{160739}on their worst mistakes.
{160838}{160871}Maybe you should.
{160888}{160927}You didn't.
{161070}{161126}You're a pain in my ass,|you know that?
{161392}{161425}Okay.
{161463}{161502}You win.
{161654}{161686}Tell my family I love 'em.
{161772}{161805}You tell 'em yourself.
{162589}{162613}Damn you.
{162795}{162819}Wait.
{163012}{163057}Let me go.
{163086}{163110}No.
{163148}{163177}No. Please, no.
{163256}{163301}It's okay.
{163350}{163374}Please.
{163423}{163447}No!
{165878}{165902}Did we get 'em all?
{165934}{165983}Are you telling me|this actually worked?
{166095}{166128}Clint, where's Nat?
{166823}{166852}Do we know|if she had family?
{166879}{166910}Yeah.
{166910}{166934}Us.
{166970}{166995}What?
{167017}{167042}Huh?
{167042}{167070}- What are you doing?|- Just asked him a question.
{167070}{167105}Yeah, no, you're acting|like she's dead.
{167105}{167133}Why are we acting|like she's dead?
{167133}{167165}We have the stones, right?
{167165}{167194}As long as we have|the stones...
{167194}{167238}Cap, we can bring her back.|Isn't that right?
{167238}{167294}So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers.|Get it together.
{167294}{167327}Can't get her back.
{167394}{167431}What's he...?|What?
{167431}{167459}It can't be undone.
{167475}{167518}It can't.
{167570}{167608}Look, I'm sorry,|no offense,
{167608}{167648}but you're a very|earthly being, okay?
{167648}{167686}And we're talking|about space magic.
{167686}{167737}And "can't" seems very definitive.|Don't you think?
{167737}{167774}Yeah, look, I know|that I'm way outside
{167774}{167810}my pay grade here.
{167810}{167850}But she still|isn't here, is she?
{167850}{167877}No, that's my point.
{167877}{167951}It can't be undone.
{167951}{167985}Or that's at least
{167985}{168033}what the red,|floating guy had to say.
{168033}{168074}Maybe you wanna go|talk to him, okay?
{168074}{168151}Go grab your hammer and you|go fly and you talk to him.
{168354}{168407}It was supposed to be me.
{168455}{168517}She sacrificed her life|for that goddamn stone.
{168517}{168554}She bet her life on it.
{168668}{168727}She's not coming back.
{168766}{168804}We have to make it|worth it.
{168820}{168853}We have to.
{168885}{168926}We will.
{169520}{169546}Boom!
{169679}{169732}All right,|the glove's ready.
{169732}{169799}Question is, who's gonna|snap their freakin' fingers?
{169799}{169856}- I'll do it.|- Excuse me?
{169856}{169877}It's okay.
{169878}{169908}Stop, stop.|Slow down.
{169908}{169945}Thor. Just wait.
{169945}{169997}We haven't decided|who's gonna put that on yet.
{169997}{170038}I'm sorry. What, we're all|just sitting around
{170038}{170070}waiting for|the right opportunity?
{170070}{170105}We should at least|discuss it.
{170105}{170153}Look, sitting here|staring at the thing
{170154}{170198}is not gonna bring|everybody back.
{170222}{170257}I'm the strongest Avenger,|okay?
{170258}{170296}So, this responsibility|falls upon me.
{170296}{170327}- Normally, you're right.|- It's my duty.
{170327}{170374}- It's not about that.|- It's not that.
{170374}{170423}- Hey, buddy...|- Stop it! Just let me.
{170490}{170527}Just let me do it.
{170527}{170593}Just let me do something good.|Something right.
{170593}{170621}Look, it's not|just the fact...
{170622}{170653}that that glove is channeling|enough energy
{170653}{170675}to light up a continent.
{170675}{170725}I'm telling you.|You're in no condition.
{170725}{170805}What do you think is coursing|through my veins right now?
{170806}{170835}Cheez Whiz?
{170894}{170921}Lightning.
{170921}{170950}Yeah.|Lightning.
{170950}{170989}Lightning won't help you, pal.
{170990}{171034}It's gotta be me.
{171065}{171119}You saw what those|stones did to Thanos.
{171119}{171158}They almost killed him.
{171190}{171254}None of you could survive.
{171254}{171298}How do we know|you will?
{171298}{171329}We don't.
{171329}{171392}But the radiation's|mostly gamma.
{171473}{171513}It's like...
{171559}{171605}I was made for this.
{172055}{172093}Good to go, yeah?
{172144}{172171}Let's do it.
{172171}{172204}Okay, remember,
{172204}{172247}everyone Thanos snapped away|five years ago...
{172247}{172307}you're just bringing them|back to now, today.
{172307}{172349}Don't change anything|from the last five years.
{172381}{172413}Got it.
{172799}{172830}<i>Friday, do me a favor</i>
{172830}{172870}<i>and activate Barn Door|Protocol, will ya?</i>
{172870}{172905}<i>Yes, boss.</i>
{173108}{173157}Everybody comes home.
{173712}{173752}Take it off! Take it off!
{173752}{173786}No, wait.|Bruce, are you okay?
{173786}{173838}<i>Talk to me, Banner.</i>
{173913}{173937}I'm okay.
{173947}{173981}I'm okay.
{174733}{174765}Bruce!
{174803}{174843}Don't move him.
{175005}{175057}- Did it work?|- We're not sure. It's okay.
{176169}{176194}Honey.
{176194}{176221}<i>Clint?</i>
{176221}{176254}Honey.
{176270}{176305}Guys...
{176362}{176398}I think it worked.
{177413}{177460}I can't breathe!|I can't breathe!
{177492}{177536}Canopy, canopy, canopy.
{177692}{177741}Rhodey, Rocket,|get out of here.
{177763}{177802}Let me up! Let me up!
{177821}{177841}Come on!
{178083}{178104}Rhodey!
{178143}{178174}Huh?
{178301}{178345}<i>Mayday, Mayday!|Does anybody copy?</i>
{178345}{178382}<i>We're on the lower level.|It's flooding!</i>
{178382}{178423}What? What?
{178423}{178482}<i>We are drowning!|Does anybody copy? Mayday!</i>
{178482}{178537}Wait! I'm here!
{178537}{178580}I'm here. Can you hear me?
{179048}{179076}Cap?
{179651}{179677}Okay.
{180138}{180172}Daughter.
{180173}{180200}Yes, Father.
{180241}{180288}So, this is the future.
{180301}{180321}Well done.
{180344}{180380}Thank you, Father.
{180381}{180417}They suspected nothing.
{180471}{180509}The arrogant never do.
{180580}{180625}Go.
{180625}{180689}Find the stones,|bring them to me.
{180689}{180731}What will you do?
{180761}{180803}Wait.
{181407}{181449}Tell me something.
{181475}{181534}In the future...
{181534}{181585}what happens|to you and me?
{181638}{181679}I try to kill you.
{181717}{181755}Several times.
{181776}{181831}But eventually...
{181831}{181878}we become friends.
{181912}{181954}We become sisters.
{182135}{182168}Come on.
{182216}{182260}We can stop him.
{182449}{182486}Come on, buddy,|wake up!
{182486}{182550}That's my man.
{182550}{182604}You lose this again,|I'm keeping it.
{182686}{182716}What happened?
{182716}{182775}You mess with time,|it tends to mess back.
{182775}{182797}You'll see.
{183326}{183362}What's he been doing?
{183404}{183440}Absolutely nothing.
{183479}{183532}Where are the stones?
{183532}{183581}Somewhere under all this.
{183612}{183668}All I know is|he doesn't have 'em.
{183668}{183714}So, we keep it that way.
{183714}{183753}You know|it's a trap, right?
{183753}{183787}Yeah.
{183787}{183822}I don't much care.
{183841}{183884}Good.
{183884}{183948}Just as long|as we're all in agreement.
{184176}{184229}Let's kill him|properly this time.
{184448}{184523}You could not live|with your own failure.
{184556}{184606}Where did that bring you?
{184672}{184718}Back to me.
{184798}{184886}I thought by eliminating|half of life...
{184886}{184944}the other half|would thrive.
{184944}{184980}But you've shown me...
{185007}{185050}that's impossible.
{185092}{185177}And as long as there are those|that remember what was...
{185177}{185212}there will always be those
{185212}{185306}that are unable to accept|what can be.
{185320}{185359}They will resist.
{185359}{185410}Yep, we're all kinds|of stubborn.
{185432}{185472}I'm thankful.
{185519}{185565}Because now...
{185565}{185629}I know what I must do.
{185629}{185704}I will shred|this universe...
{185704}{185757}down to its last atom.
{185772}{185812}And then...
{185812}{185876}with the stones|you've collected for me...
{185892}{185945}create a new one...
{185945}{186000}teeming with life...
{186000}{186049}that knows not|what it has lost...
{186049}{186109}but only|what it has been given.
{186183}{186220}A grateful universe.
{186230}{186265}Born out of blood.
{186265}{186312}They'll never know it.
{186335}{186410}Because you won't be alive|to tell them.
{186757}{186788}See you|on the other side, man.
{186841}{186894}Hang on!|I'm coming!
{187619}{187643}Yeah!
{188000}{188038}Oh, hey.
{188038}{188085}I know you.
{188151}{188180}Father...
{188194}{188234}I have the stones.
{188234}{188256}What?
{188288}{188310}Stop.
{188434}{188471}You're betraying us?
{188610}{188644}You don't have to do this.
{188708}{188774}I am this.
{188774}{188829}No, you're not.
{188829}{188880}You've seen what we become.
{189020}{189077}Nebula, listen to her.
{189110}{189132}You can change.
{189293}{189332}He won't let me.
{189368}{189387}No!
{189855}{189891}Okay, Thor. Hit me.
{190287}{190321}<i>Boss, wake up!</i>
{191550}{191580}I knew it!
{193553}{193622}In all my years|of conquest...
{193651}{193699}violence...
{193720}{193771}slaughter...
{193793}{193854}it was never personal.
{193913}{193967}But I'll tell you now...
{194011}{194104}what I'm about to do|to your stubborn,
{194104}{194164}annoying little planet...
{194203}{194259}I'm gonna enjoy it...
{194277}{194341}very, very much.
{195857}{195896}<i>Hey, Cap, you read me?</i>
{196035}{196094}<i>Cap, it's Sam.|Can you hear me?</i>
{196190}{196227}<i>On your left.</i>
{198278}{198311}Is that everyone?
{198311}{198367}What? You wanted more?
{199001}{199053}Avengers...
{199171}{199198}assemble.
{200044}{200073}Die!
{200565}{200637}No, no, give me that.|You have the little one.
{200962}{200983}Hey!
{201007}{201029}Holy cow!
{201029}{201067}You will not believe|what's been going on.
{201067}{201103}Do you remember|when we were in space?
{201103}{201137}And I got all dusty?
{201137}{201164}And I must've passed out,
{201164}{201201}because I woke up|and you were gone.
{201201}{201245}But Doctor Strange was there,|right? And he was like...
{201245}{201287}"It's been five years.|Come on, they need us."
{201287}{201323}And then he started doing|the yellow sparkly thing
{201323}{201355}- that he does all the time.|- He did? Oh, no.
{201355}{201415}- What are you doing?|- Oh.
{201511}{201549}Oh, this is nice.
{202067}{202091}Gamora?
{202315}{202357}I thought I lost you.
{202442}{202464}Ow.
{202464}{202539}Don't touch me!
{202607}{202654}You missed the first time.
{202655}{202707}Then you got 'em both|the second time.
{202751}{202784}This is the one?
{202784}{202811}Seriously?
{202811}{202865}Your choices were him|or a tree.
{203119}{203145}Cap!
{203145}{203190}What do you want me to do|with this damn thing?
{203251}{203303}Get those stones|as far away as possible!
{203303}{203333}No!
{203355}{203410}We need to get 'em back|where they came from.
{203411}{203431}No way to get 'em back.
{203431}{203478}Thanos destroyed|the quantum tunnel.
{203478}{203499}Hold on!
{203539}{203591}That wasn't|our only time machine.
{203734}{203790}Anyone see an ugly brown van|out there?
{203791}{203867}Yes! But you're not gonna like|where it's parked!
{203867}{203927}Scott, how long you need|to get that thing working?
{203951}{203981}Uh, maybe 10 minutes.
{203981}{204022}Get it started.|We'll get the stones to you.
{204023}{204062}We're on it, Cap.
{204297}{204322}Hey.
{204322}{204403}You said one out of|14 million, we win, yeah?
{204421}{204453}Tell me this is it.
{204453}{204502}If I tell you what happens...
{204502}{204534}it won't happen.
{204617}{204646}You better be right.
{204841}{204877}It's a mess back here.
{204901}{204925}It's dead.
{204955}{204996}- What?|- It's dead.
{204996}{205033}I have to hot-wire it.
{205102}{205134}Where's Nebula?
{205161}{205196}She's not responding.
{205203}{205234}Sire...
{205464}{205498}Clint!
{205546}{205573}Give it to me.
{206106}{206197}You took everything from me.
{206197}{206259}I don't even know|who you are.
{206259}{206300}You will.
{206831}{206859}I got it!
{206918}{206948}Activate Instant Kill.
{207508}{207538}Rain fire!
{207552}{207606}But, sire, our troops!
{207606}{207650}Just do it!
{208127}{208187}<i>Uh, is anyone else|seeing this?</i>
{208522}{208548}I got this!
{208548}{208603}I got this.|Okay, I don't got this.
{208603}{208634}<i>Help, somebody help!</i>
{208634}{208684}Hey, Queens, heads up!
{208920}{208950}Hang on. I got you, kid.
{209034}{209069}Hey!|Nice to meet you...
{209069}{209114}Oh, my God!
{209977}{210030}What the hell is this?
{210030}{210065}Friday,|what are they firing at?
{210065}{210109}<i>Something just|entered the upper atmosphere.</i>
{210426}{210482}Oh, yeah!
{210954}{211015}Danvers,|we need an assist here.
{211222}{211286}Hi, I'm Peter Parker.
{211302}{211338}Hey, Peter Parker.
{211338}{211371}You got something for me?
{211511}{211566}I don't know how you're gonna|get it through all of that.
{211602}{211639}Don't worry.
{211661}{211701}She's got help.
{215721}{215807}I am inevitable.
{216289}{216325}And I...
{216365}{216393}am...
{216483}{216517}Iron Man.
{219360}{219415}Mr. Stark?
{219415}{219468}Hey!
{219468}{219542}Mr. Stark.|Can you hear me?
{219542}{219581}It's Peter.
{219611}{219652}Hey.
{219672}{219749}We won, Mr. Stark.
{219789}{219845}We won, Mr. Stark.
{219881}{219959}We won! You did it, sir,|you did it.
{219959}{220010}I'm sorry.
{220010}{220034}Tony.
{220359}{220387}Hey.
{220387}{220437}Hey, Pep.
{220538}{220562}Friday?
{220562}{220634}<i>Life functions critical.</i>
{220837}{220861}Tony?
{220890}{220921}Look at me.
{220981}{221028}We're gonna be okay.
{221142}{221188}You can rest now.
{223711}{223782}<i>Everybody wants|a happy ending, right?</i>
{223782}{223844}<i>But it doesn't always|roll that way.</i>
{223889}{223930}<i>Maybe this time.</i>
{223965}{224036}<i>I'm hoping|if you play this back...</i>
{224073}{224127}<i>it's in celebration.</i>
{224127}{224225}<i>I hope families are reunited.|I hope we get it back.</i>
{224225}{224261}<i>And something like|a normal version</i>
{224261}{224322}<i>of the planet|has been restored.</i>
{224322}{224380}<i>If there ever was|such a thing.</i>
{224381}{224476}<i>God, what a world.|Universe, now.</i>
{224476}{224527}<i>If you told me 10 years ago|that we weren't alone...</i>
{224527}{224577}<i>let alone to this extent,|I mean,</i>
{224577}{224624}<i>I wouldn't have|been surprised...</i>
{224625}{224664}<i>but come on, who knew?</i>
{224665}{224733}<i>The epic forces of|darkness and light</i>
{224733}{224780}<i>that have come into play.</i>
{224780}{224825}<i>And for better or worse...</i>
{224825}{224864}<i>that's the reality|Morgan's gonna</i>
{224864}{224931}<i>have to find a way|to grow up in.</i>
{224999}{225025}<i>So, I thought I'd probably</i>
{225025}{225058}<i>better record|a little greeting...</i>
{225058}{225140}<i>in the case of an untimely death.|On my part.</i>
{225141}{225222}<i>Not that death at any time|isn't untimely.</i>
{225245}{225282}<i>This time travel thing|that we're gonna</i>
{225282}{225326}<i>try and pull off tomorrow...</i>
{225326}{225352}<i>it's got me|scratching my head</i>
{225352}{225381}<i>about the survivability|of it all.</i>
{225381}{225419}<i>That's the thing.</i>
{225462}{225511}<i>Then again,|that's the hero gig, right?</i>
{225511}{225541}<i>Part of the journey|is the end.</i>
{225589}{225616}<i>What am I even tripping for?</i>
{225617}{225644}<i>Everything is gonna work out</i>
{225644}{225719}<i>exactly the way|it's supposed to.</i>
{225801}{225842}<i>I love you 3,000.</i>
{229073}{229136}You know,|I wish there was a way
{229136}{229164}that I could let her know.
{229227}{229277}That we won.
{229308}{229351}We did it.
{229434}{229483}She knows.
{229596}{229645}They both do.
{229860}{229889}<i>How you doing, squirt?</i>
{229889}{229916}Good.
{229916}{229950}- You good?|- Mm-hmm.
{229950}{230029}- Good. You hungry?|- Mm-hmm.
{230029}{230053}What do you want?
{230072}{230108}Cheeseburgers.
{230215}{230280}You know, your dad|liked cheeseburgers.
{230280}{230312}Okay.
{230372}{230399}I'm gonna get you
{230399}{230432}all the cheeseburgers|you want.
{230432}{230456}Okay.
{230860}{230896}So...
{230896}{230959}when can we|expect you back?
{230988}{231037}Um, about that...
{231037}{231092}Thor, your people|need a king.
{231092}{231142}No, they already have one.
{231188}{231216}That's funny.
{231348}{231392}Are you being serious?
{231477}{231546}It's time for me|to be who I am...
{231546}{231610}rather than|who I'm supposed to be.
{231640}{231695}But you, you're a leader.
{231695}{231742}That's who you are.
{231795}{231845}You know, I'd make|a lot of changes around here.
{231845}{231892}I'm counting on it...
{231892}{231925}Your Majesty.
{232168}{232200}What will you do?
{232215}{232250}I'm not sure.
{232250}{232305}For the first time|in a thousand years,
{232305}{232340}I have no path.
{232340}{232380}I do have a ride though.
{232380}{232429}Move it or lose it,|hairbag.
{232533}{232581}Oh, here we are!
{232581}{232620}Tree, good to see you.
{232728}{232818}The Asgardians of the Galaxy|back together again.
{232818}{232868}Where to first?
{232890}{232927}Hey.
{232927}{232982}Just so you know,|this is my ship still.
{232982}{233016}I'm in charge.
{233016}{233083}I know. I know.|Of course you are.
{233083}{233124}Of course.
{233182}{233248}See, you say, "Of course,"|but then you touch the map.
{233248}{233275}It makes you think|that maybe
{233275}{233323}you didn't realize|I was in charge.
{233323}{233361}Quail, that's your own|insecurities in there.
{233361}{233388}Quail?
{233388}{233416}Okay? I am merely trying
{233416}{233449}to be of service|and assisting.
{233449}{233480}Quill.
{233480}{233508}That's what I said.
{233508}{233564}You should fight one another|for the honor of leadership.
{233564}{233600}Sounds fair.
{233662}{233725}- It's not necessary, okay?|- It's not.
{233725}{233751}I got some blasters,
{233751}{233784}unless you guys|wanna use knives.
{233784}{233844}Oh, yes!|Please, use knives.
{233844}{233872}Yeah. Knives.
{233872}{233912}I am Groot.
{234051}{234080}Not necessary.
{234080}{234121}There shall be|no knifing one another.
{234121}{234198}Everybody knows|who's in charge.
{234281}{234314}Me.
{234340}{234360}Right?
{234378}{234440}Yes, you.
{234440}{234499}Of course! Of course.
{234499}{234540}Of course.
{234584}{234639}Remember...
{234639}{234668}you have to return the stones
{234668}{234696}to the exact moment|you got 'em...
{234696}{234721}or you're gonna open up
{234721}{234780}a bunch of nasty|alternative realities.
{234780}{234814}Don't worry, Bruce.
{234814}{234875}Clip all the branches.
{234875}{234918}You know, I tried.
{234943}{234997}When I had the gauntlet,|the stones,
{234997}{235052}I really tried|to bring her back.
{235125}{235171}I miss her, man.
{235178}{235202}Me too.
{235295}{235356}You know, if you want,|I could come with you.
{235415}{235463}You're a good man, Sam.
{235463}{235507}This one's on me, though.
{235607}{235658}Don't do anything stupid|till I get back.
{235698}{235730}How can I?
{235730}{235779}You're taking|all the stupid with you.
{235958}{236009}Gonna miss you, buddy.
{236009}{236048}It's gonna be okay, Buck.
{236223}{236267}How long|is this gonna take?
{236267}{236339}For him, as long as he needs.|For us, five seconds.
{236460}{236492}You ready, Cap?
{236492}{236553}All right, we'll meet you|back here, okay?
{236571}{236597}You bet.
{236631}{236671}Going quantum.|Three...
{236682}{236707}two...
{236720}{236748}one.
{236794}{236846}And returning in five...
{236846}{236872}four...
{236872}{236920}three, two...
{236920}{236956}one.
{237128}{237151}Where is he?
{237152}{237202}I don't know. He blew|right by his time stamp.
{237202}{237239}He should be here.
{237369}{237395}Get him back.
{237396}{237424}- I'm trying.|- Get him the hell back.
{237424}{237474}- Hey, I said I'm trying.|- Sam.
{238045}{238085}Go ahead.
{238516}{238535}Cap?
{238590}{238633}Hi, Sam.
{238700}{238778}So, did something go wrong|or did something go right?
{238823}{238921}Well, after I put the stones|back, I thought...
{238947}{238987}maybe...
{238987}{239108}I'll try some of that life|Tony was telling me to get.
{239151}{239207}How'd that work out|for ya?
{239264}{239301}It was beautiful.
{239327}{239377}Good. I'm happy for you.
{239377}{239402}Truly.
{239416}{239451}Thank you.
{239476}{239513}Only thing|bumming me out...
{239513}{239555}is the fact I have|to live in a world
{239555}{239601}without Captain America.
{239612}{239644}Oh.
{239693}{239761}That reminds me.
{239963}{239995}Try it on.
{240605}{240643}How does it feel?
{240698}{240745}Like it's someone else's.
{240818}{240845}It isn't.
{241163}{241203}Thank you.
{241241}{241275}I'll do my best.
{241403}{241449}That's why it's yours.
{241487}{241523}You wanna tell me|about her?
{241683}{241724}No.
{241724}{241779}No, I don't think I will.
